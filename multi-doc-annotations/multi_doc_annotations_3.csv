0,"Whilst each of the programmes evaluated in this review showed some benefit to children with epilepsy, their impact was extremely variable. No programme showed benefits across the full range of outcomes, and all studies had methodological problems. There is currently insufficient evidence in favour of any single programme. Further evidence from randomised controlled trials using validated measures and considering clinical meaningfulness as well as statistical significance of results is required.","Study title: Care delivery and self‐management strategies for children with epilepsy

Abstract title: A randomized controlled trial of a manual-based psychosocial group intervention for young people with epilepsy [PIE].
1. The PIE trial was a randomized controlled trial conducted in seven UK tertiary paediatric neuroscience centers to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a manual-based psychosocial group intervention for young people with epilepsy. The intervention consisted of six weekly two-hour sessions with guided discussion, group exercises, and role-plays facilitated by an epilepsy nurse and a clinical psychologist. Results indicated a significant increase in epilepsy knowledge in the treatment group compared to the wait-list control group, as well as increased confidence in speaking to others about their epilepsy. Participants reported the greatest value of attending the group was learning about their epilepsy, learning to cope with difficult feelings, and meeting others with epilepsy. Caregiver and facilitator feedback was positive, and 92% of participants would recommend the group to others.

Abstract title: Comparison of nursing methods of pediatric epilepsy.
2. A clinical nursing procedure was modified and applied to 120 pediatric epilepsy patients. Results showed that the modified protocol produced a higher cure rate and shorter treatment duration, with fewer complications and improved satisfaction and compliance compared to the conventional protocol. It can be concluded that the modified nursing method can effectively improve pediatric epilepsy treatment.

Abstract title: Randomized trial of a program to enhance the competencies of children with epilepsy.
3. This randomized, controlled trial conducted in Santiago, Chile tested the impact of a child-centered, family-focused educational program for children aged 7-14 with epilepsy and their parents. The experimental group attended four 1 1/2-h sessions and then met together to share learning experiences, while the control group attended three 2-h sessions with a traditional lecture and question-and-answer format. Results showed that knowledge increased among children in the experimental group, and that their self-perceptions of social competency and behavior also improved. There was no impact on children's disclosure of their diagnosis to friends and others.

Abstract title: Impact of the Children's Epilepsy Program on parents.
4. In this randomized controlled trial conducted in Santiago, Chile, the efficacy of the Children's Epilepsy Program was tested. This program is a child-centered, family-focused intervention designed to help parents of children with seizure disorders to deal with their emotions, increase their knowledge, reduce anxiety, and improve their decision-making skills. The results of the study showed that parents in the experimental group had higher levels of knowledge about epilepsy and lower levels of anxiety than those in the control group.

Abstract title: Epilepsy video animation: Impact on knowledge and drug adherence in pediatric epilepsy patients and caregivers.
5. This study evaluated the impact of a video animation created to provide fundamental information about epilepsy diagnosis, treatment and drug usage for pediatric patients and their caregivers. A randomized controlled trial was conducted, with 214 participants being split into two groups. Group A received advice from a clinician and watched the video animation, while Group B only received advice. Results showed that Group A had significantly higher scores on questionnaires and drug adherence than Group B, suggesting that video animation can be a useful tool to improve both knowledge and adherence.

Abstract title: A randomized field trial of ACINDES: a child-centered training model for children with chronic illnesses (asthma and epilepsy).
6. This randomized field trial of a child-centered model of training for self-management of chronic illnesses was conducted on 355 Spanish-speaking school-aged children with moderate to severe asthma and epilepsy in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The model, based on play techniques, resulted in improved knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors in the experimental group compared to the control group. The program resulted in fewer crises and visits to physicians, a decrease in fears of child death, disruption of family life and patient-physician relationships, and reduced school absenteeism. The data suggests that an autonomous (Piagetian) model of training is key to achieving these outcomes.","The evidence suggests that tailored interventions and educational programs can have a positive impact on the care delivery and self-management of children with epilepsy.

1,"Group CBTp appears to be no better or worse than standard care or other psychosocial interventions for people with schizophrenia in terms of leaving the study early, service use and general quality of life. Group CBTp seems to be more effective than standard care or other psychosocial interventions on overall mental state and global functioning scores. These results may not be widely applicable as each study had a low sample size. Therefore, no firm conclusions concerning the efficacy of group CBTp for people with schizophrenia can currently be made.

Abstract title: Group cognitive-behavioural therapy for schizophrenia. Randomised controlled trial.
1. This study evaluated the effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioural therapy in 113 people with persistent positive symptoms of schizophrenia. There were no significant differences between the cognitive-behavioural therapy and treatment as usual on measures of symptoms or functioning or relapse. However, group cognitive-behavioural therapy treatment did result in reductions in feelings of hopelessness and in low self-esteem. Therefore, while cognitive-behavioural therapy may not be the best treatment for reducing hallucinations and delusions, it may have benefits in terms of reducing negative feelings and increasing hope for the future.

Abstract title: A randomized comparison of group cognitive-behavioural therapy and group psychoeducation in patients with schizophrenia.
2. This study compared the relative efficacy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) to Patient Psychoeducation (PE) in 88 in-patients with schizophrenia. Results indicated that patients who received CBT had lower relapse rates and higher compliance ratings than those who received PE, and were less likely to be rehospitalized during the follow-up period. Both CBT and PE resulted in significant psychopathological improvement at post-treatment and at follow-up, suggesting that CBT may be a superior and more cost-effective treatment for schizophrenia.

Abstract title: Randomized comparison of group cognitive behaviour therapy and group psychoeducation in acute patients with schizophrenia: effects on subjective quality of life.
3. The present study compared the effects of a 8-week program of 16 sessions of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) and 8 sessions of Psychoeducational (PE) treatment on Quality of Life (QoL) in 88 inpatients with schizophrenia. Both treatments resulted in significant improvements in most QoL dimensions, with no significant differences between the two treatments. These results suggest that both brief group CBT and group PE can improve subjective QoL in patients with schizophrenia.

Abstract title: A randomized comparison of group cognitive-behavioural therapy and group psychoeducation in acute patients with schizophrenia: outcome at 24 months.
4. A study of 88 patients with acute schizophrenia compared the effects of a brief group CBT and a group PE program 2 years after treatment. The CBT group showed significantly lower re-hospitalization rates and better compliance with medication at the 6-month follow-up. At the 24-month follow-up, there were no significant group differences in terms of re-admission, symptoms, or medication compliance. However, the CBT group had 21.8% fewer re-hospitalizations, 71 days less in hospital, and higher compliance ratings on average.

Abstract title: Group mindfulness-based intervention for distressing voices: A pragmatic randomised controlled trial.
5. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to study the effects of Group Person-Based Cognitive Therapy (PBCT) in 108 individuals distressed by hearing voices. Results showed that while there was no significant effect on general psychological distress, participants in the PBCT group reported significantly lower post-treatment levels of depression and lower levels of voice-related distress, perceived controllability of voices, and recovery. These effects were sustained at six-month follow-up. The study suggests that PBCT can effectively reduce distress caused by hearing voices and promote positive behavioral changes.

Abstract title: A randomized, controlled trial of cognitive behavioral social skills training for middle-aged and older outpatients with chronic schizophrenia.
6. This randomized controlled trial compared the effects of treatment as usual with treatment as usual plus cognitive behavioral social skills training on 76 middle-aged and older outpatients with chronic schizophrenia. Results showed that the patients receiving combined treatment performed social functioning activities more frequently than those in treatment as usual, and achieved greater cognitive insight and skill mastery. The greater increase in cognitive insight was significantly correlated with a reduction in positive symptoms. These findings suggest that cognitive behavioral social skills training can be beneficial for this population.

Abstract title: Randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral social skills training for older people with schizophrenia: 12-month follow-up.
7. This study examined the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST), a 24-session weekly group therapy intervention for older people with schizophrenia. Results showed that CBSST participants displayed significantly greater skill acquisition, self-reported performance of living skills, and cognitive insight at the end of treatment, which were maintained at 12-month follow-up. However, the treatment-group effect was not significant for symptoms at any assessment point. The findings suggest that CBSST may be an effective intervention for improving functioning in older people with schizophrenia.

Abstract title: Randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral social skills training for older consumers with schizophrenia: defeatist performance attitudes and functional outcome.
8. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) in improving functioning in older adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 79 participants were randomly assigned to either CBSST or Goal-Focused Supportive Contact (GFSC). Functioning was assessed using the Independent Living Skills Survey, along with other measures of positive and negative symptoms, depression, anxiety, defeatist attitudes, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. Results showed that CBSST was more effective than GFSC in improving functioning, especially for those with more severe defeatist attitudes. Both CBSST and GFSC had similar effects on reducing symptom distress, increasing motivation and self-esteem, and improving life satisfaction.

Abstract title: Randomized clinical trial of cognitive behavioral social skills training for schizophrenia: improvement in functioning and experiential negative symptoms.
9. This randomized clinical trial investigated the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral social skills training (CBSST) in improving functioning and reducing negative symptoms in consumers with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The study found that CBSST significantly improved functioning, amotivation/asociality negative symptoms, and defeatist performance attitudes compared to an active goal-focused supportive contact (GFSC) control condition. Furthermore, both treatments improved positive symptoms and social competence. The results suggest that CBSST is an effective treatment to improve functioning and reduce negative symptoms in consumers with schizophrenia.

Abstract title: A randomized controlled trial of group cognitive-behavioral therapy vs. enhanced supportive therapy for auditory hallucinations.
10. This study investigated the effectiveness of group Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for auditory hallucinations in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders compared to an enhanced supportive therapy (ST). 65 participants were randomly assigned to either CBT or ST and outcomes were evaluated post-treatment, 3 months later, and 12 months later. Results showed that ST was more effective in reducing resistance to voices and rating them as less malevolent while CBT was more effective in reducing general and total symptom scores on the PANSS. Both therapies showed improvement of outcomes at 12-month follow-up, with ST having a more specific impact on auditory hallucinations and CBT impacting general psychotic symptoms.

Abstract title: What are the effects of group cognitive behaviour therapy for voices? A randomised control trial.
11. This study tested the effectiveness of group CBT on social functioning and the severity of hallucinations in people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Results showed significant improvement in social functioning and a large cluster effect on the severity of hallucinations. Improvement in hallucinations was associated with receiving therapy early and having very experienced therapists. This suggests that group CBT can improve social functioning, but the reduction of hallucinations depend on the experience of the therapist.","

2,"Clinical judgement of GPs is more specific than sensitive for the diagnosis of dementia. It would be necessary to use additional tests to confirm the diagnosis for either target condition, or to confirm the absence of the target conditions, but clinical judgement may inform the choice of further testing. Many people who a GP judges as having dementia will have the condition. People with false negative diagnoses are likely to have less severe disease and some could be identified by using more formal testing in people who GPs judge as not having dementia. Some false positives may require similar practical support to those with dementia, but some - such as some people with depression - may suffer delayed intervention for an alternative treatable pathology.","Study title: Clinical judgement by primary care physicians for the diagnosis of all‐cause dementia or cognitive impairment in symptomatic people

Abstract title: An epidemiological study of dementia in a rural population of elderly women.
1. This study examined the prevalence of dementia in 365 women aged 70-79 living in a rural community, using the Cambridge Examination of Mental Disorders in the Elderly (CAMDEX). Senile dementia of Alzheimer type made up half the dementia cases, and the overall prevalence rates were similar to those reported in other studies. However, the prevalence rates for levels greater than mild/moderate were lower than expected, which may be due to the inclusion of subjects in institutions.

Abstract title: [Dementia diseases and minor cognitive impairments in elderly patients in general practice. Results of a cross-sectional study].
2. General practitioners in 24 Mannheim practices were able to detect dementia, including milder forms, in their elderly patients with a high degree of accuracy. A sub-sample of 407 patients was assessed using a standardized interview and test procedure and 8% of these patients were found to have clinical dementia, 8% mild dementia and 17% milder, non-disabling cognitive impairment. The proportion of affected persons in each group increased with age and the test-score profiles of the patients conformed to clinical concepts of the progressive course of dementing illness. This study emphasizes the importance of general medical practice for early detection of dementia in the elderly population.

Abstract title: Clinical judgment of GPs for the diagnosis of dementia: a diagnostic test accuracy study.
3. This study investigated the accuracy of GPs' clinical judgment for diagnosing dementia in people aged 70 or older. Two hundred and forty people were recruited from 21 practices in Bristol, UK and were assessed according to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria for dementia. Results showed that GPs' clinical judgment had a sensitivity of 56% and specificity of 89%. Positive likelihood ratio was higher in people aged 70-79 years and women, but the negative likelihood ratio was similar in all groups. The study concluded that GPs' clinical judgment of dementia is specific, but confirmatory testing is needed to exclude dementia in symptomatic people.

Abstract title: Differences in prevalence of dementia based on community survey and general practitioner recognition.
4. The study found that when GPs and epidemiological assessment procedures were used together to identify individuals with DSM-III-R dementia, the prevalence according to the GP was 2.2%, while the prevalence based on the epidemiological approach was 5.2%. It was found that CAMDEX-diagnoses of dementia were confirmed at 1-year follow-up, suggesting that the discrepancy between the two prevalence estimates was due to the low sensitivity of the GPs. Factors that contributed to this low sensitivity included help-seeking behaviour, the use of less specific diagnostic labels by the GP, and poor recognition of cognitive impairment in patients who visited the GP.

Abstract title: Do general practitioners miss dementia in elderly patients?
5. General practitioners and community nurses were asked to rate the likelihood of dementia for elderly patients. Research psychiatrists used the CAMDEX diagnostic interview to identify cases of dementia, and general practitioners correctly identified 121 out of the 208 cases. Community nurses correctly identified 64 out of the 74 known cases, but they also mistakenly suspected dementia in a greater proportion of cases. Both general practitioners and families appeared to have low expectations of what general practice can do for demented elderly people. General practitioners should take the initiative in diagnosing dementia in very elderly patients and provide understanding, support, and advice to families.

Abstract title: The prevalence of dementia as measured by the Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination.
6. This study found that 10.5% of elderly patients screened for cognitive impairment had dementia after being assessed with the Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination (CAMDEX). This rate is lower than expected based on earlier studies, and the reasons for this are discussed.

Abstract title: Do general practitioners recognize mild cognitive impairment in their patients?
7. This study aimed to determine how well GPs recognize patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in their practice population. Results showed that GPs had a very low sensitivity (11-12%) in detecting MCI, with the specificity being 93-94%. Patients with higher levels of education and comorbidity were more likely to receive false negative and false positive assignments respectively. Furthermore, GPs were better at detecting MCI when memory or multiple MCI domains were impaired. The findings suggest that there is a need for further development of the MCI concept and for the use of validated, reliable and standardized tests in primary care to improve GPs' ability to recognize MCI.

Abstract title: [Which information do GPs use to rate the cognitive status of elderly non-demented patients?].
8. This study, conducted in Dusseldorf as part of the German Competence Network Dementia, aimed to gain knowledge of the informational basis behind General Practitioners (GPs) when judging their patients' cognitive status. Results showed that GPs most often used ""general knowledge of the patient and his social setting"", ""subjective cognitive complaints of the patient"", and ""information from significant others"" when making their decisions. Neuropsychological test results were found to be irrelevant for the GPs' ratings. The findings suggest that GPs may have had difficulty applying the cognitive rating scale. Further research is recommended.

Abstract title: General practitioner diagnosis of depression and dementia in the elderly: can academic detailing make a difference?
9. This study examined the effectiveness of an academic detailing approach in improving GPs' abilities to diagnose depression and dementia in a retirement village on the outskirts of Sydney, Australia. Results showed that the GPs' ability to diagnose depression increased significantly when compared to standard screening measures, with a factor of between 2.3 and 3.3. However, the GPs did not improve in their agreement with the instruments on the diagnosis of dementia. A controlled trial would be needed to confirm these findings.

Abstract title: The detection of dementia in the primary care setting.
10. This study examined the rate of unrecognized and undocumented dementia in a primary care internal medicine private practice in Honolulu, Hawaii. Of the 297 subjects aged 65 and older, 26 cases of dementia were identified. Of these 26, 17 (65%) were not documented in outpatient medical records and 12 (67%) were not thought to have dementia by their physicians at the time of the office visit. The results indicate that dementia is often unrecognized and undocumented in private practice settings, and recognition and documentation rates increased with advancing stage of disease.","The evidence suggests that primary care physicians have a low sensitivity for diagnosing dementia, but a high specificity. Furthermore, GPs' clinical judgement has a higher likelihood ratio in people aged 70-79 years and women, although the negative likelihood ratio is similar in all groups.

Due to low certainty-evidence in many of the prespecified outcomes and non-reporting of several other outcomes of interest for this review, there is a need for further robust RCTs that use standardised terminology for maternal and offspring outcomes. Future trials should take place in a range of settings to improve generalisability of the evidence.

Abstract title: Predicting asymptomatic cervical dilation in pregnant patients with short mid-trimester cervical length: A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.
1. This study evaluated whether transvaginal ultrasound could predict asymptomatic cervical dilation on physical exam in women with short cervix (CL ≤25 mm) and no prior preterm birth. Cervical length of ≤11 mm was most predictive of cervical dilation ≥1 cm, with 75% sensitivity, 80% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 97%. Women with a CL ≤11 mm had an increased incidence of preterm birth <37 weeks, preterm birth <34 weeks, and lower birthweight than those with CL >11 mm. These findings suggest that physical exam should be considered and preterm birth prevention measures should be studied in singletons with CL ≤11 mm.

The primary outcome was preterm birth (PTB) < 37 weeks. The study was stopped early before complete enrollment, but the results showed that cervical pessary use was not associated with a reduction in PTB in this small, underpowered trial.

3. The PECEP trial was a randomized, controlled trial conducted in five Spanish hospitals to assess whether the insertion of a cervical pessary in women with a short cervix identified by routine transvaginal scanning at 20-23 weeks of gestation could reduce the rate of preterm birth. Results showed that the rate of spontaneous delivery before 34 weeks of gestation was significantly lower in the pessary group than in the expectant management group (12 [6%] vs 51 [27%], odds ratio 0.18, 95% CI 0.08-0.37; p<0.0001). No serious adverse effects were associated with the use of a cervical pessary. The study suggests that cervical pessary use could be a preventive strategy for at-risk women previously screened for cervical length assessment at the midtrimester scan.

Abstract title: Improvement of outcomes after coronary artery bypass. A randomized trial comparing intraoperative high versus low mean arterial pressure.
1. This randomized clinical trial aimed to investigate whether intraoperative mean arterial pressure below autoregulatory limits of the coronary and cerebral circulations was associated with postoperative complications in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting. 248 patients were randomized to either a low mean arterial pressure of 50 to 60 mm Hg or a high mean arterial pressure of 80 to 100 mm Hg during cardiopulmonary bypass. The results showed that the overall incidence of combined cardiac and neurologic complications was significantly lower in the high pressure group at 4.8% than in the low pressure group at 12.9%. Total mortality rate at 6 months after coronary bypass for the high and low pressure groups was 1.6% and 4.0% respectively. Cognitive and functional status outcomes did not differ between the groups. These findings indicate that higher mean arterial pressures during cardiopulmonary bypass can improve outcomes after coronary bypass.

Abstract title: Impact of 2 Distinct Levels of Mean Arterial Pressure on Near-Infrared Spectroscopy During Cardiac Surgery: Secondary Outcome From a Randomized Clinical Trial.
2. This randomized, blinded study investigated the effect of two distinct levels of mean arterial pressure (MAP) on regional cerebral oxygenation (rScO2) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). It was found that a higher MAP led to lower mean rScO2, more frequent and pronounced cerebral desaturation, and a greater cerebral desaturation load. The mechanism behind these observations is not clear, but the findings of the study do not support the recommendation of increasing MAP by vasoconstrictors to mitigate cerebral desaturation.

The primary outcome was relief of esophageal symptoms, with secondary outcomes being new onset heartburn and Achalasia-Specific Quality of Life (ASQOL). Results showed that both groups had significant improvement in esophageal symptoms, with no difference between the two groups. Additionally, there was no difference in new onset heartburn or ASQOL scores between the two groups, and patient satisfaction was similar in both groups. AOH was found to be similar to Dor in safety and efficacy, and could be performed in a shorter time.

2. A study was conducted to compare the effects of an anterior partial fundoplication and a posterior partial fundoplication following Heller cardiomyotomy for oesophageal achalasia. Results showed that the posterior fundoplication achieved more improvement in oesophageal emptying and EORTC QLQ-OES18 functional scales than the anterior fundoplication, but no differences between the two anti-reflux repairs were noted in terms of HRQL evaluations and objective assessment of gastro-oesophageal acid reflux.

Abstract title: Randomized controlled trial of laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication versus Nissen fundoplication for achalasia: long-term results.
3. A prospective, randomized trial was conducted to compare the long-term results of laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication versus laparoscopic Heller myotomy plus floppy-Nissen fundoplication for the treatment of achalasia. Of the 144 patients included in the trial, 71 underwent Dor fundoplication and 67 underwent Nissen fundoplication. No statistically significant differences in clinical or instrumental GER were found between the two groups; however, the recurrence rate of dysphagia was significantly higher among the patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication. These findings suggest that Dor fundoplication is the preferred method to re-establish GER control in patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy.

Abstract title: Heller myotomy versus Heller myotomy with Dor fundoplication for achalasia: a prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial.
4. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, 43 patients with achalasia were assigned to undergo either Heller myotomy or Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication. The results showed that Heller plus Dor was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) (relative risk 0.11) and a lower median distal esophageal acid exposure time (0.4%) compared to the Heller group (4.9%). No significant difference was observed in surgical outcome between the two techniques. Therefore, Heller Myotomy plus Dor Fundoplication was found to be superior to Heller myotomy alone in reducing the incidence of postoperative GER.","The evidence suggests that Dor Fundoplication is the preferred method for re-establishing Gastroesophageal Reflux Control (GERC) in patients undergoing Laparoscopic Heller's Cardiomyotomy for Achalasia.

7,"Based on the available evidence, this review does not support use of currently available nerve repair devices over standard repair. There is significant heterogeneity in participants, injury pattern, repair timing, and outcome measures and their timing across studies of nerve repair using bioengineered devices, which make comparisons unreliable. Studies were generally small and at high or unclear risk of bias. These factors render the overall certainty of evidence for any outcome low or very low. The data reviewed here provide some evidence that more people may experience adverse events with use of currently available bioengineered devices than with standard repair techniques, and the need for revision surgery may also be greater. The evidence for sensory recovery is very uncertain and there are no data for muscle strength at 24 months (our primary outcome measures). We need further trials, adhering to a minimum standard of outcome reporting (with at least 12 months' follow-up, including integrated sensorimotor evaluation and patient-reported outcomes) to provide high-certainty evidence and facilitate more detailed analysis of effectiveness of emerging, increasingly sophisticated, bioengineered repair devices.","Study title: Bioengineered nerve conduits and wraps for peripheral nerve repair of the upper limb

Abstract title: A prospective clinical evaluation of biodegradable neurolac nerve guides for sensory nerve repair in the hand.
1. In this randomized, multicenter trial, thirty patients with 34 nerve lesions were treated with either a biodegradable poly(DL-lactide-epsilon-caprolactone) Neurolac nerve guide (experimental group) or current standard reconstruction techniques (control group). The results showed that the nerve guide could be easily implanted, with more complications in the experimental group but none of them being device related. Recovery of sensibility in the nerve guide group was at least as good as in the control group, indicating that the Neurolac nerve guide is suitable for repairing transected peripheral nerves in the hand.

Abstract title: Collagen conduit versus microsurgical neurorrhaphy: 2-year follow-up of a prospective, blinded clinical and electrophysiological multicenter randomized, controlled trial.
2. In a prospective randomized trial, 43 patients with 44 lacerations of the ulnar or median nerve were repaired using either a collagen nerve conduit or conventional microsurgical techniques. Results showed no difference in sensory function, discomfort, or total Rosen scores between the treatment groups after 24 months. Motor scores were significantly better for the direct suture group after 12 months. However, there were no statistically significant differences in amplitudes, latencies, or conduction velocities between the groups after 24 months. The use of a collagen conduit to repair nerve lacerations is safe and results in equivalent recovery of sensory and motor functions 24 months after repair when the nerve gap inside the tube is 6 mm or less.

Abstract title: Tubular repair of the median or ulnar nerve in the human forearm: a 5-year follow-up.
3. A study of 30 patients with median or ulnar nerve injuries in the distal forearm found that tubular nerve repair was comparable to routine microsurgical repair in terms of functional sensibility after 5 years. Cold intolerance was found to be less severe with the tubular technique. There was ongoing improvement of functional sensibility in the total group throughout the 5 years after repair.

Abstract title: Tubular versus conventional repair of median and ulnar nerves in the human forearm: early results from a prospective, randomized, clinical study.
4. In this prospective, randomized clinical study, 18 patients were assigned to either tubulization or conventional microsurgical repair for transected median and ulnar nerves in the forearm. Results showed no significant difference between the two techniques, with the exception of perception of touch, which favored the tubulization technique at the 3-month checkup. At re-exploration 11 months after the initial procedure, the gap was replaced by regenerated nerve tissue in direct continuity, suggesting that human major nerve trunks have the capacity to reconstruct themselves when the environment is optimal and surgery is minimized.

This study evaluated the use of a polyglycolic acid conduit to repair nerves in the hand in a randomized, prospective, multicenter trial. 98 patients with 136 nerve transections were enrolled and randomized into two groups. Results showed no significant difference between the two groups as a whole. However, when the sensory recovery was examined with respect to length of nerve gap, nerves with gaps of 4 mm or less had better sensation when repaired with a conduit.

Abstract title: Home-visiting intervention to improve child care among American Indian adolescent mothers: a randomized trial.
1. This randomized controlled trial found that a paraprofessional-delivered home-visiting intervention to pregnant American Indian adolescents was successful in increasing mothers' child care knowledge and involvement. Results showed that the intervention group had significantly higher parent knowledge scores at 2 and 6 months postpartum and scored higher on maternal involvement scales at 2 months postpartum. No differences were found for child care skills. Further research is needed to understand the potential of this intervention to improve adolescent parenting outcomes in American Indian communities.

Abstract title: Effect of a paraprofessional home-visiting intervention on American Indian teen mothers' and infants' behavioral risks: a randomized controlled trial.
2. The authors conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of the Family Spirit intervention on American Indian teen mothers and their children. The intervention included home visits delivered by paraprofessionals and optimized standard care. Results showed that mothers in the intervention group had higher parenting knowledge, self-efficacy, home safety attitudes, and fewer externalizing behaviors. Additionally, their children had fewer externalizing and dysregulation problems and lower scores for externalizing and internalizing problems. No differences were observed for outcomes measured by the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment scale. The findings suggest that the Family Spirit intervention can improve parenting and infant outcomes, potentially reducing the risk of behavioral or drug use problems in the future.

Abstract title: Informing Precision Home Visiting: Identifying Meaningful Subgroups of Families Who Benefit Most from Family Spirit.
3. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program has invested $2 billion over the past 5 years to improve mothers' and children's outcomes. A secondary data analysis of the most recently completed randomized controlled trial of Family Spirit, a federally endorsed home-visiting intervention, was conducted to determine how baseline characteristics of mothers' substance use, depression, and demographic characteristics moderated mothers' and children's intervention-related outcomes. Results suggest that children born to mothers with past substance use histories benefited more from the intervention than those born to abstinent mothers, and that unstable housing, parity, and low educational attainment emerged as moderators of intervention effectiveness. These results can be used to design and evaluate an evidence-based precision approach to Family Spirit, and may provide insight into tailoring variables for other models to optimize impact and efficiency.

Abstract title: The Family Spirit trial for American Indian teen mothers and their children: CBPR rationale, design, methods and baseline characteristics.
4. The Family Spirit trial is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of an American Indian paraprofessional-delivered home-visiting intervention to reduce health and behavioral risks for teen mothers and their children. 322 pregnant teens from 28 weeks gestation until the baby's third birthday were randomized to receive the Family Spirit intervention plus Optimized Standard Care, or Optimized Standard Care alone. Baseline characteristics were evenly distributed between groups, except for higher lifetime cigarette use and depressive symptoms among intervention mothers. If successful, the trial will provide evidence supporting multi-generational prevention of behavioral health disparities affecting young American Indian families and the utility of indigenous paraprofessional interventionists in under-resourced communities.

Abstract title: Design and implementation of a dental caries prevention trial in remote Canadian Aboriginal communities.
5. This cluster randomized trial is testing the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing as an approach to promoting behaviour change and controlling dental caries in young Aboriginal children. Aboriginal women have been recruited from 9 communities to administer questionnaires and deliver the counseling to mothers. The communities were randomly allocated to test or control groups by a random ""draw"" over community radio. Despite the random assignment of communities, group differences exist for stage of pregnancy and prior tooth extractions in the family. This paper highlights the challenges of conducting randomized trials in remote settings and the importance of thorough community collaboration.

Abstract title: The Healthy Children, Strong Families intervention: design and community participation.
6. Healthy Children, Strong Families (HCSF) is a two-year randomized controlled trial of a healthy lifestyle intervention conducted in partnership with four Wisconsin American Indian tribes. The intervention consists of one year of targeted home visits to deliver nutritional and physical activity curricula and during the second year, intervention families receive monthly newsletters and attend monthly group meetings. The primary outcomes are decreased child BMI z-score and decreased primary caregiver BMI. Secondary outcomes include increased fruit/vegetable consumption, decreased TV viewing, increased physical activity, decreased soda/sweetened drink consumption, improved primary caregiver biochemical indices, and increased primary caregiver self-efficacy. The study was designed using community-based participatory research and data collection strategies are described with emphasis on the communities' input.

Abstract title: Using community advisory boards to reduce environmental barriers to health in American Indian communities, Wisconsin, 2007-2012.
7. Healthy Children, Strong Families was a family-based and community-based intervention to increase healthy lifestyles on Wisconsin American Indian reservations. Community advisory boards (CABs) were established by the residents and university partners, with meetings held at various times and locations to increase participation. Over 5 years, 71 CAB meetings occurred with a total of 1,070 participants, resulting in successful interventions such as community gardens, food-related policies, a playground, and recreational facilities. CABs are now self-sustaining, showing that academic researchers can partner with community residents to create programs and policies that improve community health.

Abstract title: Understanding Correlates of Physical Activity in American Indian Families: The Healthy Children Strong Families-2 Study.
9. This study examined the factors associated with physical activity among American Indian families with young children. It was found that age, television viewing and computer use were associated with decreased odds of being active for adults, while high adult activity, longer weekday sleep and family income were associated with increased odds of being active for children. The findings suggest that interventions to increase physical activity in this population should focus on decreasing adult screen time and increasing child sleep time.

4. This long-term study of 44 patients in Chicago found that argon laser photocoagulation had a sustained effect on reducing the incidence of vitreous hemorrhage and visual loss associated with it. Only one episode of vitreous hemorrhage occurred in the 25 laser-treated eyes, while nine (45%) of the 20 control eyes had recurrent vitreous hemorrhage. Choroidal neovascularization and retinal detachment, which are laser-induced complications, did not have any long-term visual sequelae. 47% of study eyes had new sea fan evolution, indicating the need for long-term surveillance.

5. This randomized prospective clinical trial evaluated the effectiveness of feeder vessel photocoagulation for proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. Argon laser and xenon arc photocoagulation were used in Chicago and Kingston, respectively. Results showed that the treatment reduced the incidence of vitreous hemorrhage and visual loss from vitreous hemorrhage. However, the treatments were associated with an increased risk of choroidal neovascularization (xenon arc greater than argon laser) and retinal detachment (argon laser), although no visual loss from these complications has been seen in the patients in this trial.

6. Photocoagulation techniques, such as feeder vessel and scatter photocoagulation, have been used to treat Proliferative Sickle Cell Retinopathy (PSR). A prospective randomised trial of feeder vessel photocoagulation showed a decreased incidence of vitreous haemorrhage and visual loss in treated eyes compared to untreated eyes, however this technique can be associated with choroidal neovascularisation and retinal tears. A prospective randomised trial of scatter photocoagulation also showed a decreased incidence of vitreous haemorrhage and visual loss in treated eyes, with no complications noted. Local scatter photocoagulation is recommended for areas of PSR, with 360 degrees of peripheral circumferential treatment recommended for unreliable patients. If scatter photocoagulation does not result in sufficient regression of neovascularisation, feeder vessel treatment can be used to supplement the scatter treatment.","The evidence concludes that laser therapy, specifically argon laser scatter photocoagulation and feeder vessel photocoagulation, is an effective and safe way to treat proliferative sickle cell retinopathy.

1. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the effects of individually prescribed homeopathic medicines on 175 children with frequent upper respiratory tract infections. Results showed that the mean daily symptom score was lower in the treatment group compared to the placebo group, and both groups experienced a significant reduction in the use of antibiotics compared to the year before the trial. There was also a lower proportion of adenoidectomies in the treatment group, but no difference in the proportion of tonsillectomies between the two groups.

Abstract title: Effectiveness of budesonide aerosol in ventilator-dependent preterm babies: a preliminary report.
1. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed to assess the short-term effects of a topical glucocorticoid (budesonide 600 mu g twice daily) vs. placebo administered directly into endotracheal tubes of intubated preterm infants for 7 days. After 7 days of treatment, the treatment group showed significant improvements in ventilator settings, while the placebo group did not, and there were no significant changes in serum cortisol levels or bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts. There were also no differences in side effects between the groups. The results suggest that topical budesonide produces clinical improvement in ventilated preterm infants without glucocorticoid side effects.

Abstract title: Inhaled salbutamol and beclomethasone for preventing broncho-pulmonary dysplasia: a randomised double-blind study.
2. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study aimed to evaluate the effects of inhaled salbutamol and beclomethasone on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in ventilator-dependent premature neonates. 173 infants with an average gestational age of 27.6-27.8 weeks were randomly assigned to four groups and given either placebo + placebo, placebo + salbutamol, placebo + beclomethasone or beclomethasone + salbutomol for 28 days. The results showed no significant difference in survival, diagnosis and severity of BPD, duration of ventilatory support or oxygen therapy between the treatment and control groups. Therefore, the use of inhalable salbutamol and beclomethasone is not recommended for the prevention of BPD in premature ventilated neonates.

Abstract title: Fluticasone inhalation in moderate cases of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
3. This randomized-controlled trial found that inhaled fluticasone propionate was not effective in reducing the duration of supplemental oxygen therapy or need for ventilatory support for preterm infants with moderate bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, the fluticasone group did show a decrease in chest radiograph score and higher arterial blood pressure compared to baseline. Therefore, the results do not support the use of inhaled corticosteroids to treat oxygen dependent infants with moderate BPD.

4. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the feasibility and safety of administering beclomethasone dipropionate to ventilated infants with early chronic lung disease via a metered-dose inhaler. Nineteen infants were enrolled and received either placebo or beclomethasone for 7 days or until extubation. No adverse effects on blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, ventilator settings, oxygen therapy, ROP, infections, blood glucose, weight, or cortisol levels were observed in the beclomethasone group. Results showed that beclomethasone may be administered safely without adverse effects, and may even enhance extubation in infants with early BPD, though further research is needed.

Abstract title: Effect of point of care testing for C reactive protein and training in communication skills on antibiotic use in lower respiratory tract infections: cluster randomised trial.
1. This study investigated the effect of two interventions - C reactive protein point of care testing and training in enhanced communication skills - on antibiotic prescribing for lower respiratory tract infection in general practices in the Netherlands. Results showed that both interventions significantly reduced antibiotic prescribing without compromising patients' recovery and satisfaction with care. A combination of the illness and disease focused approaches may be necessary to achieve the greatest reduction in antibiotic prescribing for this common condition in primary care.

Abstract title: Point-of-care C-reactive protein testing and antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections: a randomized controlled trial.
2. This randomized controlled trial of 258 patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and rhinosinusitis found that the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing to assist in prescribing decisions, including delayed prescribing, significantly reduced antibiotic use after the index consultation and during follow-up without compromising patient recovery or satisfaction.

Abstract title: Randomised controlled trial of CRP rapid test as a guide to treatment of respiratory infections in general practice.
3. This randomized controlled trial looked at the effect of GPs using a C-reactive protein (CRP) rapid test to assess whether the frequency of antibiotic prescriptions to patients with respiratory infections was reduced. The results showed that the frequency of antibiotic prescriptions was not significantly different between the CRP and control groups. However, patients in the CRP group reported increased or unchanged morbidity 1 week after the consultation more frequently than those in the control group. The variable that had the greatest influence on whether GPs prescribed antibiotics in the control group was the patients' general well-being, while in the CRP group, it was the CRP value. Overall, the use of the CRP rapid test in support of a possible antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections in general practice cannot be recommended.

Abstract title: Point-of-care C-reactive protein testing to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics for non-severe acute respiratory infections in Vietnamese primary health care: a randomised controlled trial.
4. In a multicentre open-label randomised controlled trial in ten primary health-care centres in northern Vietnam, C-reactive protein point-of-care testing was assessed to determine if it could safely reduce antibiotic use in patients with non-severe acute respiratory tract infections. Results showed that the test reduced antibiotic use within 14 days of follow-up without compromising patients' recovery. Additionally, time to resolution of symptoms was similar in both groups and adverse events were rare. Qualitative analysis is needed to implement this strategy in low-income and middle-income countries.

5. This was a three-group, randomized controlled trial that took place from 2018 to 2020 in 60 Swiss general practices. The study assessed whether point-of-care procalcitonin and lung ultrasonography could reduce unnecessary antibiotic treatment in patients with lower respiratory tract infections in primary care. The results showed that point-of-care procalcitonin led to a 26% absolute reduction in the probability of 28 day antibiotic prescription without affecting patients' safety, while point-of-care lung ultrasonography did not further reduce antibiotic prescription.

6. This international study found that Internet-based training in C-reactive-protein point-of-care testing, communication skills, or both combined reduced antibiotic prescribing for lower respiratory tract infections at 3 months, with risk ratios of 0.68, 0.53, and 0.38 respectively. After 12 months, communication training remained effective in reducing antibiotic prescribing, while C-reactive-protein training was ineffective for lower RTIs. Materials were provided for free, but clinicians rarely used booklets or CRP testing.

7. In a study of 239 adults with possible lower respiratory tract infection, the use of a rapid test for C-reactive protein (CRP) was compared to no test to determine if it would reduce prescription of antibiotics. 56% of the CRP group and 60% of the control group were prescribed antibiotics, but the difference was not significant. Antibiotics were strongly associated with the finding of crackles and wheezes, but not with cough, dyspnoea or chest pain. Slow recovery was associated with high age, absence of fever and a normal CRP value. No benefit of the CRP test was demonstrated.

Abstract title: Effect of a Short-Course Treatment with Synbiotics on Plasma p-Cresol Concentration in Kidney Transplant Recipients.
1. In this study, thirty-six kidney transplant patients with stable graft function, who had not experienced an episode of acute rejection or infection in the last three months, were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate the effects of synbiotic treatment on the reduction of plasma p-Cresol levels. After 15 and 30 days of treatment, plasma p-Cresol levels decreased by 40% and 33%, respectively, in the synbiotic group, while remaining stable in the placebo group. There were no changes in renal function, glycemia, plasma lipids, or albumin concentration, and the treatment was well tolerated. These results suggest that synbiotics may be an effective way to reduce plasma p-Cresol concentrations in kidney transplant patients. Larger, longer-term studies are needed to determine if cardiovascular risks can be reduced with this nutritional intervention.

2. A randomized placebo-controlled study of 95 patients undergoing liver transplantation investigated the effects of early enteral nutrition with either a standard formula plus selective bowel decontamination, a fiber-containing formula plus living Lactobacillus plantarum 299, or a fiber-containing formula plus heat-killed L plantarum 299. Results showed that the group receiving living lactobacilli plus fiber had a significantly lower rate of bacterial infections (13%) than the group with SBD (48%) or the group with inactivated lactobacilli and fiber (34%). The living Lactobacillus group also had shorter antibiotic treatment, hospital stay, and stay on the intensive care unit, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. This ecoimmunonutrition could provide a cost-effective alternative to SBD and should be further evaluated.

1. This study aimed to compare the effects of endometrial sampling on pregnancy rates during IUI cycles. 150 patients were randomly assigned into three groups; Group 1 was the control group and underwent IUI without endometrial sampling, Group 2 underwent Tao Brush endometrial sampling on day 8-9 of the uterine cycle preceding the stimulation cycle, and Group 3 underwent Tao Brush endometrial sampling on day 8-9 of the same IUI cycle. Results showed that pregnancy rates were 18%, 38%, and 36% for Group 1, 2, and 3 respectively, with the paired t test showing a highly significant value for the paired t test of the control group and Group 2 (p=0.001), and a highly significant value between Group 3 and the control group (p=0.002). It was concluded that endometrial sampling significantly increases pregnancy rates in IUI procedures when done in the proliferative phase of the IUI cycle, or the cycle prior to IUI, than pregnancy rates with IUI alone.

5. This prospective randomized control study evaluated the effect of endometrial biopsy (EB) on intrauterine insemination (IUI) outcome in controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) cycles. The study enrolled 251 subjects and split them into three groups; Group A had EB taken between Days 19 and 24 of the spontaneous menstrual cycle that preceded fertility treatment and IUI, which was done in the next cycle. Group B had EB taken before Day 6 of the menstrual cycle, with fertility treatment and IUI done in that same cycle. Group C (the control group) did not have EB in the previous 3 cycles. Results showed a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) for Group B (31.11%) compared to Group C (9.3%). CPR was highest after the first cycle of ovulation induction and IUI following EB scratch in both Groups A and B (P<0.001).

Abstract title: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of metformin treatment for weight gain associated with initiation of risperidone in children and adolescents.
1. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, 49 patients with schizophrenia were given metformin (500 mg bid) or placebo with risperidone (6 mg). After 12 weeks, weight, height, and body mass index were measured, and changes in weight and BMI were evaluated. Results showed a significant difference between weight and BMI in both metformin and placebo group, but metformin treatment did not show a significant effect to control the body weight of patients after 12 weeks.

Abstract title: Metformin for prevention of weight gain and insulin resistance with olanzapine: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
2. In a double-blind study of 40 patients, taking olanzapine (10 mg daily), 20 were randomly allocated to a metformin group (850 to 1700 mg daily) and 20 to a placebo group. After 14 weeks, there was no difference in body weight gain (kg) between the metformin and placebo groups. However, glucose levels decreased significantly after metformin administration, the HOMA-IR decreased in both groups, and cholesterol profile improved significantly. Triglyceride levels increased in the metformin group. The results suggest that metformin does not prevent olanzapine-induced body weight gain and that carbohydrate metabolism impairment was not systematically observed during short-term olanzapine administration.

Abstract title: Insulin counter-regulatory factors, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein during olanzapine administration: effects of the antidiabetic metformin.
3. In this study, 37 patients with chronic schizophrenia were given olanzapine and 19 patients were given metformin and 18 were given placebo in a randomized, double-blind protocol. The Authors assessed some insulin counter-regulatory factors, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein after olanzapine administration, and the effect of metformin on these variables. Results showed that olanzapine was associated with decreased insulin resistance, and cortisol, fibrinogen and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels decreased in both groups. Glucagon significantly increased after metformin, and leptin tended to increase after placebo. The C-reactive protein did not change significantly in any group. Despite similar weight gain, metformin did not have the same effect on leptin as placebo, suggesting a beneficial effect of the antidiabetic agent.

Abstract title: Nizatidine for prevention of weight gain with olanzapine: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
4. This double-blind trial evaluated the efficacy of the histamine H-2 receptor antagonist, nizatidine, in limiting weight gain in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders taking olanzapine. Results showed that nizatidine 300 mg b.i.d. had a significant, though transient, effect in limiting weight gain at weeks 3 and 4. However, this effect was not seen at 16 weeks. Nizatidine was generally well-tolerated and did not adversely affect clinical outcomes.

Abstract title: Effects of Olanzapine Combined With Samidorphan on Weight Gain in Schizophrenia: A 24-Week Phase 3 Study.
5. This phase 3 double-blind trial evaluated the weight profile of the combination treatment of olanzapine and samidorphan compared with olanzapine alone in patients with schizophrenia. Results showed that the olanzapine/samidorphan combination treatment was associated with significantly less weight gain and smaller increases in waist circumference compared to olanzapine, and had similar efficacy in treating schizophrenia symptoms. Adverse events in both groups included weight gain, somnolence, dry mouth, and increased appetite. Metabolic changes were small and similar between treatments.

Abstract title: Topiramate for prevention of olanzapine associated weight gain and metabolic dysfunction in schizophrenia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
6. This study assessed the efficacy of topiramate to prevent olanzapine-induced weight gain and adverse metabolic effects in 72 drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients. Results showed that topiramate resulted in a significant weight loss, decrease in leptin, glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride levels and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In the olanzapine group, there was a significant weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Additionally, the topiramate group experienced a greater clinical improvement as measured by PANSS scores. The adverse effects were well tolerated.

Abstract title: Olanzapine-induced weight gain in patients with first-episode schizophrenia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of fluoxetine addition.
7. In this 8-week double-blind study, 30 first-episode hospitalized schizophrenia patients were randomly assigned to either a group receiving olanzapine (10 mg/day) plus fluoxetine (20 mg/day) or a group receiving olanzapine (10 mg/day) plus placebo. The results showed that the group receiving olanzapine plus fluoxetine had significantly less improvement in positive and disorganized symptom dimensions than the group receiving olanzapine plus placebo, but both groups experienced similar and substantial gradual weight gains, suggesting that fluoxetine coadministration is ineffective in attenuating olanzapine-induced weight gain.

Abstract title: Attenuation of olanzapine-induced weight gain with reboxetine in patients with schizophrenia: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
8. This study examined the effects of adding the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor reboxetine to olanzapine treatment in 26 patients with a first-episode DSM-IV schizophrenic disorder. Results showed that patients taking olanzapine and reboxetine had significantly lower increases in body weight than those taking olanzapine and placebo. Additionally, fewer patients in the olanzapine/reboxetine group gained at least 7% of their initial weight, compared to the olanzapine/placebo group. The addition of reboxetine was found to be safe and well-tolerated, and also led to a greater reduction in Hamilton depression scale scores. These findings suggest that activating the adrenergic system through the use of a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor may reduce olanzapine-induced weight gain in schizophrenia patients.

Abstract title: The effect of famotidine addition on olanzapine-induced weight gain in first-episode schizophrenia patients: a double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study.
9. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, fourteen first-episode DSM-IV schizophrenia patients were given either famotidine (40 mg/day) or placebo in addition to olanzapine (10 mg/day) for 6 weeks. Both groups showed a similar increase in body weight, with 57.1% of the olanzapine/famotidine group and 42.9% of the olanzapine/placebo group gaining at least 7% of their initial body weight. Famotidine did not prevent or attenuate olanzapine-induced weight gain and was safe and well-tolerated.

Abstract title: Attenuating effect of reboxetine on appetite and weight gain in olanzapine-treated schizophrenia patients: a double-blind placebo-controlled study.
10. This double-blind study investigated the effects of co-administering reboxetine and olanzapine in 59 patients with first-episode DSM-IV schizophrenic disorder. The results showed that those who took olanzapine and reboxetine had a significantly lower increase in body weight compared to those who took olanzapine and placebo, with fewer of the olanzapine/reboxetine-treated patients gaining at least 7% of their initial weight. Appetite increase was significantly lower in the olanzapine/reboxetine group and was correlated with attenuation of weight gain. Reboxetine addition was safe and well tolerated, suggesting that it may be an effective strategy to reduce SGA-induced weight gain in the long term, alongside behavioral management and diet counseling.

Abstract title: Attenuating effect of reboxetine on appetite and weight gain in olanzapine-treated schizophrenia patients: a double-blind placebo-controlled study.
11. This study examined the use of the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor reboxetine to attenuate olanzapine-induced weight gain in patients with first-episode DSM-IV schizophrenic disorder. Results indicated that patients taking olanzapine/reboxetine showed significantly less of an increase in body weight than those taking olanzapine/placebo, with fewer gaining at least 7% of their initial weight. Appetite increase was also lower in the olanzapine/reboxetine group, and reboxetine was deemed safe and well-tolerated. The results suggest that combined with behavioral management and diet counseling, reboxetine may have clinical utility in controlling SGA-induced weight gain.

Abstract title: Metformin addition attenuates olanzapine-induced weight gain in drug-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
12. This study investigated the efficacy of metformin in preventing olanzapine-induced weight gain in forty patients with schizophrenia. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive either olanzapine plus metformin or olanzapine plus placebo for 12 weeks in a double-blind fashion. The results showed that the weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio levels increased less in the olanzapine plus metformin group relative to the olanzapine plus placebo group. Additionally, fewer patients in the olanzapine plus metformin group increased their baseline weight by more than 7%, and there was no difference in the SAPS and SANS scores between the two groups. Overall, the results suggest that metformin is effective and safe in attenuating olanzapine-induced weight gain and insulin resistance in drug-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients.","
The evidence suggests that pharmacological interventions, such as metformin and reboxetine, can help to prevent or attenuate olanzapine-induced weight gain in people with schizophrenia. Additionally, adding norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors to olanzapine treatment may reduce weight gain, while fluoxetine co-administration may be ineffective in this regard.

19,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of laser therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars. The available information is also insufficient to perform a more accurate analysis on treatment-related adverse effects related to laser therapy. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, conflicting results, study design issues and small sample sizes, further high-quality trials, with validated scales and core outcome sets should be developed. These trials should take into consideration the consumers' opinion and values, the need for long-term follow-up and the necessity of reporting the rate of recurrence of scars to determine whether lasers may achieve superior results when compared with other therapies for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars.","Study title: Laser therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars

Abstract title: Evaluation of scars in children after treatment with low-level laser.
1. A randomized controlled study of 15 children aged 2-10 who had post-burn hypertrophic scars found that low-level laser therapy (He-Ne) combined with topical treatment was effective at reducing scarring, with neither adverse effects nor differences in blood perfusion between the treated and control areas. It is recommended that photobiomodulation be used as part of a combination therapy for improved results.

Abstract title: New combination of triamcinolone, 5-Fluorouracil, and pulsed-dye laser for treatment of keloid and hypertrophic scars.
2. This clinical trial studied the effectiveness of different treatments for keloids and hypertrophic scars. 69 patients were randomly assigned to three groups and received intralesional triamcinolone acetonide, a combination of triamcinolone acetonide and 5-fluorouracil, or a combination of the two plus pulsed-dye laser treatment. Results showed that the combination of triamcinolone acetonide and 5-fluorouracil plus pulsed-dye laser treatment was the most effective, producing the best results in terms of erythema score, itch reduction, and patient satisfaction. Atrophy and telangiectasia were seen in 37% of patients in the triamcinolone acetonide group.

Abstract title: Therapeutic Efficacy of Intralesional Steroid With Carbon Dioxide Laser Versus With Cryotherapy in Treatment of Keloids: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
3. This randomized controlled trial compared the therapeutic efficacy of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide in combination with carbon dioxide laser (Group 1) and cryotherapy (Group 2) for the treatment of keloids. Results showed no statistically significant difference in therapeutic response between the two groups at the end of 12 months. Both treatments were found to be equally effective in reducing keloid thickness, volume and improving patient and observer assessments.

Abstract title: Combined effects of long-pulsed neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser, diprospan and 5-fluorouracil in the treatment of keloid scars.
4. A clinical trial of 69 patients with keloid scars was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of intralesional injection of diprospan, a combination of diprospan and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and a combination of diprospan, 5-FU, and neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser irradiation. The results demonstrated that the combination of diprospan + 5-FU + Nd:YAG was the most effective treatment, with a 69% response rate among the 62 patients who completed the study. The combination treatment was also significantly better than diprospan or diprospan + 5-FU in reducing erythema, pruritus, and pliability.

Abstract title: Combination of pulsed dye laser and verapamil in comparison with verapamil alone in the treatment of keloid.
5. This study compared the efficacy of a combination of pulsed dye laser and intralesional verapamil against intralesional verapamil alone in the treatment of keloids. Forty patients were randomly divided into two groups and received four sessions of therapy. The improvement of lesion height and length, as well as overall appearance, was significantly higher in the PDL+ intralesional verapamil group than in the verampil only group. The results suggest that combination therapy with PDL+ intralesional verapamil may be more effective than intralesional verapamil alone in the treatment of keloids.

Abstract title: Energy density and numbers of treatment affect response of keloidal and hypertrophic sternotomy scars to the 585-nm flashlamp-pumped pulsed-dye laser.
6. This study sought to determine whether the therapeutic outcome of the 585-nm flashlamp-pumped pulsed-dye laser (PDL) treatment for keloids and hypertrophic scars varies with the energy density (fluence) of the laser pulses and the number of treatments. Ten previously untreated scars were divided into four segments and randomly treated with a PDL at a fluence of 3, 5, and 7 J/cm2 every four weeks for a total of six treatment sessions. Results showed a significant improvement in scar height, erythema, and pliability in all laser-treated areas, with no statistically significant fluence dependence. However, multiple treatments (>2) appeared to provide a greater percentage of scar resolution.

Abstract title: Treatment response of keloidal and hypertrophic sternotomy scars: comparison among intralesional corticosteroid, 5-fluorouracil, and 585-nm flashlamp-pumped pulsed-dye laser treatments.
7. This study compared the clinical response of keloidal and hypertrophic scars to treatment with intralesional corticosteroid alone or combined with 5-FU, 5-FU alone, and the 585-nm flashlamp-pumped pulsed-dye laser (PDL). Results showed clinical improvement in all treated segments, with no significant difference in treatment outcome between modalities. Intralesional formulas resulted in faster resolution than the PDL, however, adverse sequelae were observed in 50% of segments that received corticosteroid intralesionally alone. No long-term adverse sequelae were demonstrated in the segments treated with other modalities.

Abstract title: Nonablative fractional laser resurfacing for the treatment of hypertrophic scars: a randomized controlled trial.
8. This intraindividual randomized controlled trial found that 1540-nm nonablative fractional laser therapy was not statistically effective in the treatment of hypertrophic scars as assessed by a blinded Physician Global Assessment. However, patient global assessments 1 and 3 months after treatment showed significant differences, suggesting that the treatment may be beneficial. The treatment was found to be safe, with patients experiencing moderate pain and mild adverse events.

9. This prospective, single-blind, randomized, internally controlled study examined the efficacy of the 585-nm flashlamp-pumped pulsed-dye laser and silicone gel sheeting on hypertrophic scars in lighter- and darker-skinned patients. Twenty patients with hypertrophic scars, with a mean duration of 32 months, were monitored for blood flow, elasticity, volume, pruritus, pain, burning, and histological assessments. Results showed a reduction in blood flow, volume, and pruritus (P = .001, .02, and .005, respectively) over time, but no differences were found between the treated and control groups in terms of pain, burning, elasticity, fibrosis, or mast cells. The study concluded that the improvements in scar sections treated with silicone gel sheeting and pulsed-dye laser were no different than in control sections.","The evidence suggests that laser therapy, combined with topical treatments and other modalities, can be an effective treatment for hypertrophic and keloid scars.

1. This study compared the infection rates of simple lacerations irrigated with tap water versus sterile normal saline before repair. 46 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive tap water or normal saline for wound irrigation. After the procedure was complete, patients were scheduled for a 48 hour follow-up wound check. There were 2 infected lacerations in both the tap water and normal saline groups, and no difference in colony counts when tap water was used. The results of this study suggest that the use of tap water for irrigation of wounds may be safe, but further validation is necessary.

2. This double-blind randomized controlled trial tested whether there were differences in wound infection and healing rates when wounds were cleansed with tap water or sterile normal saline. Twenty-two subjects were recruited from a local hospital in Hong Kong and were randomly assigned to wound cleansing with tap water (experimental group) or sterile normal saline (control group). Results showed no significant difference between the two groups in terms of wound infection and healing rates. This suggests that tap water is a safe alternative to sterile normal saline for wound cleansing in a community setting.

Abstract title: Randomized, controlled study comparing sitz-bath and no-sitz-bath treatments in patients with acute anal fissures.
3. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of sitz baths in the management of acute anal fissures. The results showed that while the sitz bath group reported lower pain scores than the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. There was also no significant difference in fissure healing between the two groups. However, the sitz bath group reported higher levels of satisfaction than the control group. Adverse effects were reported in a few patients. Overall, this study suggests that sitz baths may improve patient satisfaction in acute anal fissures, but further research is needed to assess the efficacy and safety of this treatment.

Abstract title: A randomized, controlled trial of oral and intramuscular dexamethasone in the prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.
2. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of oral and intramuscular antenatal administration of dexamethasone in reducing neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. After randomizing 170 women with 188 fetuses, the results showed no statistical difference in the frequency of respiratory distress syndrome between the two groups. However, a subgroup analysis of those delivered at <34 weeks' gestation revealed a significant increase in sepsis and intraventricular hemorrhage in the oral group, without any benefit. Thus, the study concluded that oral administration of dexamethasone increases neonatal morbidity without any benefit and should not be used clinically for induction of fetal pulmonary maturation.

Abstract title: Betamethasone dosing interval: 12 or 24 hours apart? A randomized, noninferiority open trial.
5. This prospective, randomized, open, noninferiority trial studied 228 mothers with singleton or multiple pregnancies at risk of preterm delivery. Betamethasone was administered in 2 doses either 12 or 24 hours apart in a 2:1 ratio. The results showed that the incidence of RDS was similar in both cohorts, but there was an increased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis with the 12-hour dosing interval. The authors concluded that a 12-hour dosing interval is equivalent to the 24-hour dosing interval for the prevention of RDS in neonates of mothers delivering prematurely, but a larger multicenter study is needed to confirm the findings.

Abstract title: Displaced fractures of the distal femur in elderly patients. Operative versus non-operative treatment.
1. This study compared operative and non-operative treatments for displaced fractures of the distal femur in elderly patients. The operative group had a higher success rate (53%) and shorter time to discharge, but more complications than the non-operative group (31%).

Abstract title: Bridge plate osteosynthesis using dynamic condylar screw (DCS) or retrograde intramedullary supracondylar nail (RIMSN) in the treatment of distal femoral fractures: comparison of two methods in a prospective randomized study.
2. Two surgical techniques, dynamic condylar screw (DCS) and retrograde intramedullary supracondylar nail (RIMSN), have been compared to treat 68 closed fractures of the distal femur. DCS provided faster operation times with more blood loss, while RIMSN provided a less blood loss. There were no significant differences in terms of cumulative rate of union, range of motion of the knee, overall results and complications between the two groups. Both DCS and RIMSN are viable options for the treatment of distal femoral fractures.

Abstract title: Extra Articular Supracondylar Femur Fractures Managed with Locked Distal Femoral Plate or Supracondylar Nailing: A Comparative Outcome Study.
3. This randomized prospective study compared the outcomes of locked compressive plating and retrograde nailing for the management of extra articular supracondylar femur fractures. Results showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of duration of surgery, intraoperative blood loss, time to union, and functional scores. The study concluded that surgical planning and expertise were more important than the choice of implant for optimal results, and that with the Less Invasive Stabilization System (LISS), technical errors must be avoided.

Abstract title: Retrograde intramedullary nail fixation compared with fixed-angle plate fixation for fracture of the distal femur: the TrAFFix feasibility RCT.
4. This feasibility study assessed the suitability of a definitive trial to evaluate the efficacy of intramedullary fixation with a locked retrograde nail and extramedullary fixation with a fixed angle plate for the treatment of distal femur fractures. The process evaluation showed that surgeon-related factors were the primary barriers to recruitment. A total of 23 participants were randomised and analysed. The recruitment rate was estimated to be 0.42 participants per centre per month, lower than the prespecified feasibility threshold of 1.0 participants per centre per month. Data completeness of the EuroQol-5 Dimensions was estimated at 65%. A modified protocol is proposed for a definitive trial with an internal pilot to confirm initial recruitment rate assumptions.

Abstract title: Intramedullary nails versus distal locking plates for fracture of the distal femur: results from the Trial of Acute Femoral Fracture Fixation (TrAFFix) randomised feasibility study and process evaluation.
5. This feasibility study and process evaluation assessed the potential success of a clinical trial comparing intramedullary fixation with locked retrograde nails and extramedullary fixation with fixed angle plates for fractures of the distal femur. The study was conducted at seven NHS hospitals in England and included 82 eligible patients aged 18 and over. The primary outcomes measured were the recruitment rate and completion rate of the EQ-5D-5L at 4 months post-randomisation. Results showed a recruitment rate of 0.42 participants per centre-month and a data completeness of 61%. The main barriers to recruitment were identified as variation in treatment pathways, lack of surgeon equipoise and confidence in both interventions, and lack of cohesion in newly formed research cultures. The study concluded that a modified trial design with embedded recruitment support intervention was feasible.

Abstract title: Retrograde nailing versus fixed-angle blade plating for supracondylar femoral fractures: a randomized controlled trial.
6. This study compared two methods of treating supracondylar femoral fractures: retrograde intramedullary nailing and fixed-angle blade plate fixation. 22 patients were recruited and followed for 12-36 months. Results showed that three patients in the intramedullary nailing group required revision surgery for implant removal, while no reoperations occurred in the blade plate group. There was a trend towards greater pain in the intramedullary nailing group, but no statistically significant difference in SF-36 scores. Both methods gave good outcomes, but intramedullary nailing showed a higher rate of revision surgery and greater levels of pain.

1. This randomized controlled trial compared the effectiveness of EM-guided and endoscopic nasoenteral feeding tube placement among 161 adult patients admitted to intensive care units. The total success rate of correct jejunal placement was 91.4% in the EM-guided group and 95% in the endoscopic group. The EM-guided group had more placement attempts, longer placement time, and shorter inserted nasal intestinal tube length, but shorter total procedure duration, higher discomfort level and recommendation scores, and lower costs. The results of the trial showed that EM-guided placement is as fast, safe, and successful as endoscopic placement and may be a preferred technique in critically ill patients.

2. The CORE trial is a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial looking at the effectiveness of electromagnetic (EM) guided bedside placement of nasoenteral feeding tubes in surgical patients compared to endoscopic placement. 154 patients will be randomly allocated to either technique and the primary outcome will be the reinsertion of the feeding tube. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes, costs and tube-related complications. The study could lead to wider implementation of EM guided placement as the method of choice for placement of nasoenteral feeding tubes.

Abstract title: Clinical trial design--effect of prone positioning on clinical outcomes in infants and children with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
1. This paper describes the methodology of a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of prone positioning in pediatric patients with ALI. The trial is designed to compare ventilator-free days between children treated with prone and supine positioning. Secondary endpoints include time to lung injury recovery, organ failure-free days, functional outcome, adverse events, and mortality. Patients 42 weeks postconceptual age to 18 years of age are enrolled and prone positioning is implemented within 4 hours of randomization for a maximum of 7 days.

2. This was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of 102 pediatric patients from 7 US pediatric intensive care units aged 2 weeks to 18 years who were treated with supine vs prone positioning. The results showed that there was no difference in ventilator-free days between the two groups, nor in any of the secondary end points. Therefore, prone positioning does not significantly reduce ventilator-free days or improve other clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with acute lung injury.

3. This study found that prone positioning can be safely used in pediatric patients with acute lung injury, with no difference in endotracheal tube leak, inadvertent extubation rate, enteral nutrition management, pain and sedation management, and staff utilization between the prone and supine groups. Pressure ulcers were similar between the two groups, and no critical events occurred during the prone positioning procedure. However, more staff and more time were needed to reposition patients in the prone position.

4. In this randomized controlled trial, ten children with acute respiratory failure were studied to compare the effect of the prone and supine positions on oxygenation. Results showed that oxygenation was significantly better in the prone position compared to the supine position over a 12-hour period. Additionally, urine output increased while prone, leading to a significantly improved fluid balance. There were no serious adverse effects associated with the prone position.

Abstract title: Successful glucocorticoid treatment for patients with abnormal autoimmunity on in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer.
1. A study was conducted to analyze the effects of glucocorticoid treatment for patients with abnormal autoimmunity on IVF-ET outcomes. Low-dose predonisolone or dexamethasone was administered in 51 IVF-ET cycles of 41 patients with positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-DNA antibody, and/or lupus anticoagulant (LAC). It was found that significant increases in pregnancy and implantation rates were observed in antibody-positive patients with corticosteroid treatment, while no significant differences were observed in antibody-negative patients with or without glucocorticoid administration. The results indicate that the combined use of low-dose corticosteroid can be effective for autoantibody-positive women.

Abstract title: The addition of a glucocorticoid to the protocol of programmed oocyte retrieval for in-vitro fertilization--a randomized study.
2. This study investigated the effects of adding glucocorticoids to the protocol of ovulation induction for in-vitro fertilization (IVF) in 78 infertile women diagnosed with tubal factor infertility. Three groups of patients were studied, one control group (Group A; n=24) and two experimental groups receiving either 0.5mg (Group B; n=27) or 1mg (Group C; n=27) dexamethasone. The results showed no significant differences in the mean number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rates, oestradiol, luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone serum concentrations, number of embryo transfers and pregnancy rates between the three groups. Therefore, the addition of up to 1mg dexamethasone daily to the protocol of ovulation induction for oocyte retrieval did not improve the overall IVF-embryo transfer outcome in patients with tubal factor infertility.

3. A prospective, randomized study was conducted to determine the effect of ""low-dose,"" long-acting glucocorticoids on pregnancy and implantation rates in 99 consecutive transfer cycles of frozen-thawed embryos to women with tubal factor infertility only. Results showed that the pregnancy rate was 13.5% in patients treated with the drug compared with 12.8% in the control group. The implantation rates were similar. Therefore, it was concluded that the use of 0.5 mg dexamethasone to improve immunosuppression did not improve the implantation or pregnancy rates.

Abstract title: Does addition of low-dose aspirin and/or steroid as a standard treatment in nonselected intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles improve in vitro fertilization success? A randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled study.
4. This study investigated the effects of short-term low-dose aspirin and/or steroid use on implantation and pregnancy rates in nonselected intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. 200 patients were randomized into four groups—aspirin (100 mg/day), prednisolone (10 mg/day), aspirin and prednisolone, and placebo. Results showed no statistically significant differences in demographic, ovulation induction cycle characteristics, mean transferred embryo number, mean top quality embryo number, implantation and pregnancy rates between the study groups. Thus, administration of aspirin and prednisolone alone or concomitant as a standard treatment had no positive effects on implantation and/or pregnancy rates.

Abstract title: Prednisolone supplementation to Clomid and/or gonadotrophin stimulation for in-vitro fertilization--a prospective randomized trial.
5. The results of a randomized trial showed that patients who were given prednisolone (7.5 mg daily) alongside Clomid and/or gonadotrophins during an In-vitro Fertilization (IVF) cycle resulted in significantly higher clinical pregnancies (16) than the group who were not given the corticosteroid (6). The prednisolone group also showed higher estrogen levels during the ovulatory phase and lower levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and androgen hormones such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and testosterone. It is suggested that prednisolone may counteract the detrimental effect of a stress-related androgen excess, which can lead to cystic degeneration of follicles, as seen in polycystic ovarian disease.

Abstract title: The immunotherapy during in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer cycles in infertile patients with endometriosis.
6. This study investigated the effect of immunotherapy with corticosteroids on the pregnancy rate in infertile patients with endometriosis who underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET). 40 patients with endometriosis plus tubal factor and 87 patients with pure tubal factor were randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups. The results showed that the treatment group had a significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate per cycle than the control group in patients with endometriosis plus tubal factor (42.6% vs 22.8%). There was no significant difference in the clinical pregnancy rate per cycle between the treatment and control groups in patients with pure tubal factor (40.7% vs 34.5%). Additionally, the study found that immunotherapy with corticosteroids was more effective in patients with positive autoantibodies (40.9% vs 14.8%). This suggests that immunotherapy with corticosteroids may improve the clinical pregnancy rate in endometriosis patients undergoing IVF-ET.

Abstract title: Low-dose glucocorticoids after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer have no significant effect on pregnancy rate.
7. In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 206 stimulation cycles and 61 cryopreservation cycles were observed to determine if low-dose glucocorticoid treatment (plus 250 mg of oral tetracycline four times daily for 4 days) had any effect on pregnancy rate. The results showed that the clinical pregnancy and implantation rates between placebo and glucocorticoid groups were similar, and none of these differences were statistically significant. Therefore, it was concluded that glucocorticoid plus antibiotic treatment does not have a significant effect on pregnancy or implantation rates for transfers of nonmicromanipulated embryos.

8. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of immunosuppression as an adjunct to improving the success of IVF-ET. 75 patients were randomized to receive either prednisone or placebo, and both groups had similar ages and numbers of preembryos transferred. The implantation and clinical pregnancy rates were higher in the prednisone group, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. There was no difference in the ongoing pregnancy rate between the prednisone group (30.7%) and the placebo group (28.0%). No side effects were reported.

This study investigated the impact of a 6-week twice-per-week Iyengar yoga program on Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms in adolescents and young adults (YA). 51 participants completed the intervention, with 24% baseline attrition. Results showed that compared to the control group, adolescents assigned to yoga reported improved physical functioning, while YA assigned to yoga reported improved IBS symptoms, global improvement, disability, psychological distress, sleep quality, and fatigue. 44% of adolescents and 46% of YA reported minimal clinically significant reduction in pain after yoga, and one-third of YA reported clinically significant levels of global symptom improvement. Global improvement was immediately post-yoga for both age groups, however only global improvement, worst pain, and nausea maintained at the 2-month follow-up for YA. These findings suggest that a brief Iyengar yoga intervention is a feasible and safe adjunctive treatment for young people with IBS, leading to benefits in multiple domains of functioning.

Abstract title: The effect of aerobic exercises among women with mild and moderate irritable bowel syndrome: A pilot study.
3. This study evaluated the effect of aerobic exercises on a treadmill on the severity of symptoms and quality of life among women with mild and moderate IBS. Twenty women were divided into two groups, one which completed six weeks of aerobic exercises on a treadmill and the other which continued their usual daily activities. The results showed that the treadmill group experienced a significant improvement in the severity of IBS symptoms and quality of life compared to the control group. This suggests that aerobic exercises may be an effective way to reduce the symptoms and improve the quality of life of women with mild and moderate IBS.

Abstract title: Physical activity improves symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.
4. This study compared the effects of physical activity on symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in 102 patients. The physical activity group was instructed to increase their physical activity while the control group was instructed to maintain their lifestyle. Results showed that the physical activity group experienced significant improvement in their IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) score compared to the control group, and that physically active patients experienced less symptom deterioration than those who were physically inactive. The study concludes that increased physical activity is an effective primary treatment for IBS and should be used as such.","The evidence concludes that physical activity is an effective primary treatment for IBS and should be used as such.

Abstract title: [Efficiency of nebulised magnesium sulphate in infective exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
1. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of nebulized magnesium sulphate (MS) in COPD exacerbations. Twenty patients were randomized into two groups and treated with oxygen, antibiotics and oral corticosteroids with one group receiving ipratropium bromide (IB) and MS, and the other group receiving IB and placebo. The results showed no significant changes in FEV1 values across both groups, however, dyspnea scores decreased significantly in the MS group at both 24 and 48 hours and PEFRs at 10 and 30 minutes were significantly greater in the MS group. Nebulized MS was found to be a safe, effective, and feasible addition to the standard bronchodilator treatment for COPD exacerbations.

2. This study aimed to evaluate the bronchodilator efficacy of magnesium sulfate as a treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 72 individuals were randomly assigned to receive either 1.2 g of magnesium sulfate or placebo after initial albuterol treatment. Peak expiratory flow was monitored for 45 minutes, and it was found that the peak expiratory flow increased significantly more in the magnesium sulfate group than the placebo group.

32,"The currently available evidence on the effectiveness of adjunctive steroid therapy versus antibiotics alone in the management of acute endophthalmitis after intraocular surgery is inadequate. We found no studies that had enrolled cases of acute endophthalmitis following intravitreous injection. A combined analysis of two studies suggests that use of adjunctive steroids may provide a higher chance of having a good visual outcome at three months than not using adjunctive steroids. However, considering that most of the confidence intervals crossed the null, and that this review was limited in scope and applicability to clinical practice, it is not possible to conclude whether the use of adjunctive steroids is effective at this time. Any future trials should examine whether adjunctive steroids may be useful in certain clinical settings such as type of causative organism or etiology. These studies should include outcomes that take patients' symptoms and clinical examination into account; report outcomes in a uniform and consistent manner; and follow up at short- and long-term intervals.","Study title: Adjunctive steroid therapy versus antibiotics alone for acute endophthalmitis after intraocular procedure

1. This is a prospective, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the use of intravitreal dexamethasone as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of presumed bacterial endophthalmitis. 62 patients completed the protocol and were divided into two groups: one receiving intravitreal dexamethasone and one receiving intravitreal placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in the visual outcomes of either group. Subgroup analysis suggested a trend to better visual acuity in the post cataract steroid subgroup. No adverse events were reported. Intravitreal dexamethasone appears safe and may be of benefit in post cataract surgery bacterial endophthalmitis.

1. This phase 2 open-label trial investigated the safety and feasibility of stenting of symptomatic vertebral artery stenosis of at least 50%, in patients with a recent transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke. 115 patients were randomly assigned to stenting plus best medical treatment or best medical treatment alone. The primary outcome was the composite of vascular death, myocardial infarction, or any stroke within 30 days after the start of treatment. Results showed that stenting was associated with a major periprocedural vascular complication in about 1 in 20 patients, and the risk of recurrent vertebrobasilar stroke under best medical treatment alone was low, questioning the need for and feasibility of a phase 3 trial.

Abstract title: Stenting for symptomatic vertebral artery stenosis: The Vertebral Artery Ischaemia Stenting Trial.
2. The Vertebral Artery Ischaemia Stenting Trial (VIST) was a prospective, randomized, open-blinded endpoint clinical trial in the UK that compared the risks and benefits of vertebral angioplasty and stenting with best medical treatment (BMT) alone for symptomatic vertebral artery stenosis. Results showed that, of 61 patients who were stented, there were no periprocedural complications for extracranial stenting, while there were 2 strokes during intracranial stenting. The primary endpoint of fatal or nonfatal stroke occurred in 5 patients in the stent group vs 12 in the medical group, with an absolute risk reduction of 25 strokes per 1,000 person-years.

Abstract title: European-Canadian randomized trial of paclitaxel in relapsed ovarian cancer: high-dose versus low-dose and long versus short infusion.
1. This study investigated the dose-response relationship and safety of Taxol (paclitaxel) in relapsed ovarian cancer patients. Patients were randomized to receive either 175 or 135 mg/m2 of Taxol over either 24 or 3 hours. Severe hypersensitivity reactions were rare (1.5%) and were not affected by either dose or schedule. Response was slightly higher at the 175-mg/m2 dose (20%) than at 135 mg/m2 (15%), with significantly longer progression-free survival in the high-dose group (19 v 14 weeks, P = .02). Significantly more neutropenia was seen when Taxol was administered as a 24-hour infusion, but response rates were similar between the 24- and 3-hour groups (19% and 16%, respectively). Overall, the 3-hour infusion of Taxol is safe when given with premedication and is associated with less neutropenia and a modest dose effect.

Abstract title: Preliminary evaluation of a multicenter, randomized comparative study of TAXOL (paclitaxel) dose and infusion length in platinum-treated ovarian cancer. Canadian-European Taxol Cooperative Trial Group.
2. A clinical trial was conducted to research the effects of Taxol, a cytotoxic agent, on ovarian cancer patients. The trial had a 2 x 2 factorial design, with 407 patients randomized to receive either 175 or 135 mg/m2 of Taxol by either 24- or 3-hour infusion, with all patients receiving premedication. Results showed an overall response rate of 18.5%, with responses occurring more frequently in those who received 175 mg/m2. It was concluded that Taxol can be administered safely over 3 hours with premedication and that further studies should be conducted to determine the maximally tolerated dose.

3. This study found that increasing the dose of paclitaxel to 250 mg/m2 resulted in a higher rate of partial and complete response compared to 175 mg/m2 (36% vs. 27%, respectively). However, progression-free and overall survival results were similar between the two doses, and increased toxicity was observed with the higher dose. Additionally, doubling the prophylactic filgrastim dose from 5 to 10 microg/kg did not reduce the frequency of neutropenic fever with the higher paclitaxel dose.

This Phase III prospective study compared the survival benefits, objective response rate, and toxicities of weekly paclitaxel and three-weekly paclitaxel in patients with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian and peritoneal cancers. Results showed that weekly paclitaxel achieved better outcomes than three-weekly paclitaxel in terms of survival benefits, quality of life, and toxicities. The objective response rate for weekly paclitaxel was 27%, and for three-weekly paclitaxel, it was 16%. The median progression-free survival was 7 months for weekly paclitaxel, and 4.5 months for three-weekly paclitaxel, while the median overall survival was 15.5 months and 12.5 months for weekly and three-weekly paclitaxel, respectively.

Abstract title: Concomitant use of cholinesterase inhibitors and anticholinergics: prevalence and outcomes.
2. This study found that 37% of adults aged 50 and older who began using a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChI) between 2000 and 2007 were also using an anticholinergic (ACh) medication, with 11% using two or more moderate to potent AChs. The median duration of concomitant use was 4 months, and 25% continued to use both medication classes for longer than 12 months. Further, 23% of ChI users had AChs being used at the time of ChI therapy initiation, and 77% of this ACh use was not stopped once ChIs were started. There was no association observed between concomitant use and risk of death or nursing home placement. This highlights the prevalence and potential inappropriateness of concomitant ChI and ACh use, and the need for efforts to improve care standards.

5. This study investigated the heterogeneity of dementia progression in two longitudinal population-based cohort studies with 512 people with incident dementia from Stockholm. The results showed that 76% of the participants had slow progression on both cognition and daily functioning, while 24% had more rapid worsening. Factors related to slower progression included Alzheimer's disease dementia type, lower age, fewer comorbidities, and a stronger social network. This suggests that these factors may be useful for counseling and optimizing care in dementia.

Abstract title: Anticholinergics and benzodiazepines on cognitive impairment among elderly with Alzheimer's disease: a 1 year follow-up study.
6. This study examined the effects of anticholinergic medications on cognition among older adults with Alzheimer's disease who received acetylcholine esterase inhibitors over 12 months. The most commonly prescribed anticholinergic medication was quetiapine, which was used to treat behavioral and psychological symptoms. Results indicated that the use of anticholinergics was associated with lower global cognitive scores compared to those without anticholinergic exposure. These findings suggest that the use of anticholinergics may be a trade-off between controlling BPSD and worsening cognitive impairment, and that greater awareness of the potential anticholinergic effect is important.

The results showed that those exposed to AD had a greater tendency for cognitive and functional impairment, with an average difference of -4 (4.5) in the Barthel Index and -0.3 (0.4) in the Lawton and Brody Scale, and -1 (0.9) in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).

Abstract title: Chronic exposure to anticholinergic medications adversely affects the course of Alzheimer disease.
9. This study aimed to examine the effect of chronic exposure to anticholinergics in a cohort of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. The study population of 69 patients was divided into two groups: those receiving one or more concomitant medications with significant anticholinergic properties (N=16) and those receiving no concomitant medications with anticholinergic properties (N=53). Results showed that at 2 years, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were significantly worse for patients receiving anticholinergic medications than for those not on anticholinergics. These findings suggest that concomitant therapy with anticholinergics may have a negative effect on acetylcholinesterase therapy, or that chronic exposure to anticholinergics may have adverse effects on the clinical course of AD.

Abstract title: How do potentially inappropriate medications and polypharmacy affect mortality in frail and non-frail cognitively impaired older adults? A cohort study.
10. This study examined whether potentially inappropriate medications, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or polypharmacy, were associated with a higher mortality rate in cognitively impaired older adults. Of the 1154 cognitively impaired participants, 44% were taking one or more potentially inappropriate medication. Use of specific PIM was not associated with greater subsequent mortality apart from antipsychotics. Polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy were associated with mortality, as was being frail or pre-frail. There was some evidence that the risk of mortality associated with polypharmacy was lower among frailer individuals, though the overall interaction was not significant. The results of this study suggest that greater concern should be paid to the number of medications than the prescription of individual classes, and that frailer individuals may have a lower risk of mortality associated with polypharmacy.

Abstract title: Anticholinergic Burden and Risk of Stroke and Death in People with Different Types of Dementia.
11. This study found that anticholinergic cognitive burden was associated with a higher risk of stroke and death in people with different types of dementia. Those with an ACB score of 1 or higher had a significantly higher risk of developing the composite outcome of stroke and death compared to those who did not use anticholinergics. These findings suggest that caution should be taken when prescribing medications with anticholinergic properties to people with dementia.

Abstract title: Anticholinergic Medication Burden and 5-Year Risk of Hospitalization and Death in Nursing Home Elderly Residents With Coronary Artery Disease.
12. Elderly nursing home patients in Italy were studied to assess the association between anticholinergic medication burden and hospitalization and mortality. The anticholinergic burden was assessed through the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scale. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, those with an ACB of 1 and ACB of 2+ had an increased risk of hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Furthermore, the risk for the primary outcome increased for those with CAD according to ACB level. The results suggest that the effectiveness and safety profile of drug regimens should be reconsidered in this population.","The evidence suggests that anticholinergic burden is associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalization, lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores at diagnosis and a sharper increase in MMSE scores over the subsequent 6 months, slower progression in cognition and daily functioning, lower global cognitive scores, a greater likelihood of functional decline, falls and delirium, and an increased risk of hospitalization and all-cause mortality.

Abstract title: Massage reduces anxiety in child and adolescent psychiatric patients.
1. The study found that after five days of daily 30-minute back massages, hospitalized depressed and adjustment disorder children and adolescents experienced decreased levels of depression, anxiety, and cortisol, as well as improved nighttime sleep, lower levels of norepinephrine, and increased cooperation and cooperation as rated by nurses.

Abstract title: Clinical field testing of an enhanced-activity intervention in hospitalized children with cancer.
2. This pilot study investigated the feasibility of an enhanced physical activity intervention for pediatric oncology patients receiving treatment for a solid tumor or AML. Of the 29 participants, 25 had a solid tumor and 4 had AML. Results from ANOVA analysis showed that sleep efficiency was significantly better in the experimental arm than in the control arm. A mixed model (repeated measures) analysis did not show a difference between sleep duration or sleep efficiency between the two arms. The findings suggest that an inpatient EPA intervention can be delivered successfully and provide design and statistical considerations for a larger effectiveness study.

Abstract title: Pilot Study of Massage to Improve Sleep and Fatigue in Hospitalized Adolescents With Cancer.
3. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of providing massage therapy as an intervention to help improve sleep in hospitalized adolescent oncology patients. Results showed that the majority of patients approached for the study consented, and almost all of them in the intervention group received at least one massage. There were trends toward increased night time and overall sleep in the intervention group compared to the control group, but no differences in patient-reported outcome measures. Participant and parent feedback was positive, leading to the launch of a clinical massage service at the hospital. The results suggest that massage therapy may be a feasible and beneficial intervention for adolescent oncology patients.

Abstract title: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of an Intervention to Promote Psychological Well-Being in Critically Ill Children: Soothing Through Touch, Reading, and Music.
4. This pilot randomized controlled trial examined the feasibility and acceptability of a PICU Soothing intervention designed to improve psychological well-being in children and their parents. The intervention included parental comforting (touch and reading) and music through soft headbands, administered once daily throughout hospitalization. Acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and methods were assessed through participation rates, observation, measurement completion rates, interviews, and telephone calls. Results indicated the intervention was acceptable and feasible, with positive responses from parents and nurses, and pilot data suggesting lower intervention group child and parent anxiety after transfer to hospital wards. These results support the implementation of a full-scale trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.

Abstract title: A pilot randomized controlled trial to improve sleep and fatigue in children with central nervous system tumors hospitalized for high-dose chemotherapy.
5. This study examined the effectiveness of a sleep intervention compared to standard of care in preserving nighttime sleep in children undergoing intensive cancer treatment. The intervention was found to modestly preserve sleep duration, although overall sleep was poor in both groups. The results also showed that higher nighttime activity and lower percent sleep were associated with higher next-day fatigue scores. It was concluded that sleep is an important factor in the health of children receiving cancer treatment, and further research into sleep preservation methods is needed.

Abstract title: A computer-compatible method for observing falling asleep behavior of hospitalized children.
6. This study observed 18 hospitalized children, aged 3 to 8, over the course of 3 nights to analyze their nighttime separation behaviors. A bedtime story was played for one group on the second and third night. Results showed that the story-children fell asleep quicker, exhibited more sleepy behaviors, and had longer periods of contact with parents. It appears that hearing a bedtime story recorded by a parent helps hospitalized children cope with the separation experience.

7. This study tested a strategy to promote night sleep in 94 3-8 year old hospitalized children. Results showed that the parent-recorded story group had significantly longer sleep onset latency and a higher incidence of distress behaviors than the other groups. The group with parents present at bedtime had significantly longer SOL than the no-story group, and the difference between the parent-recorded and the stranger-recorded group was significant. No significant differences between groups were seen in self-soothing behaviors.","The evidence suggests that non-pharmacological interventions, such as providing a bedtime story recorded by a parent, can help hospitalized children cope with the separation experience and promote nighttime sleep.

40,"Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.","Study title: Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children

Abstract title: Doubling the dose of budesonide versus maintenance treatment in asthma exacerbations.
1. A double-blind controlled trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of doubling the daily dose of maintenance inhaled corticosteroid to treat or prevent progression of asthma exacerbations. 290 patients were evaluated over a 6-month period and randomized to either a continued maintenance dose (MD) or doubling the dose (DD) at the time of an exacerbation. Results showed that there was no significant difference between the MD and DD groups in terms of treatment failure rate. This suggests that doubling the maintenance dose of inhaled corticosteroid may not affect the pattern of the exacerbation.

Abstract title: Low-dose budesonide with the addition of an increased dose during exacerbations is effective in long-term asthma control. On behalf of the Italian Study Group.
2. This study compared the effects of a 6-month treatment with two different doses of budesonide in 213 patients with moderate asthma who had previously been treated with beclomethasone dipropionate. After a 2-week run-in period and 1-month treatment with a high dose of budesonide, the patient's symptoms and lung function were monitored each month. Results showed that a low dose of budesonide (200 microg/d) was as effective as the standard dose (800 microg/d) in controlling symptoms and lung function. In addition, the addition of inhaled budesonide (800 microg/d) at onset of an asthmatic exacerbation had a beneficial clinical effect.

Abstract title: Treatment of acute asthmatic exacerbations with an increased dose of inhaled steroid.
3. This study investigated the effectiveness of increasing the dose of inhaled steroids as part of an asthma self-management plan in treating asthma exacerbations in children aged 6-14. Results showed that there was no significant difference between increasing inhaled steroids or placebo on morning or evening peak expiratory flow rates, diurnal peak flow variability, or symptom scores in the two weeks following an asthma exacerbation. Spirometric function and the parents' opinion of the effectiveness of asthma medications were also not significantly different between inhaled steroid or placebo. The study concluded that increasing the dose of inhaled steroids at the onset of an exacerbation of asthma is ineffective and should not be included in asthma self management plans.

Abstract title: Doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid to prevent asthma exacerbations: randomised controlled trial.
4. In this randomised controlled trial, 390 individuals with asthma were monitored for up to 12 months to investigate the effects of doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids when asthma deteriorates. When peak flow or symptoms deteriorated, participants added an active or placebo corticosteroid inhaler to their usual corticosteroid for 14 days. The primary outcome was the number of individuals starting oral prednisolone in each group. The risk ratio for starting prednisolone was 0.95, indicating that doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids when asthma deteriorates is not an effective intervention.

Abstract title: Quintupling Inhaled Glucocorticoids to Prevent Childhood Asthma Exacerbations.
5. In a study of 254 children, 5 to 11 years of age, with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma, researchers found that quintupling the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids at early signs of loss of asthma control did not reduce the rate of severe asthma exacerbations or improve other asthma outcomes. Additionally, it was associated with diminished linear growth.

Abstract title: Use of beclomethasone dipropionate as rescue treatment for children with mild persistent asthma (TREXA): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
6. In this 44-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 843 children and adolescents with mild persistent asthma were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. The primary outcome was time to first exacerbation that required oral corticosteroids and the secondary outcome was linear growth. Results showed that frequency of exacerbations was lower in the daily, combined, and rescue beclomethasone groups, compared with the placebo group. There was a significant decrease in treatment failure in the combined, daily, and rescue beclomethasone groups, compared with the placebo group. Linear growth was 1.1 cm less in the combined and daily arms, but not the rescue group. The study concluded that children with mild persistent asthma should not be treated with rescue albuterol alone and the most effective treatment to prevent exacerbations is daily inhaled corticosteroids.

Abstract title: Quadrupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid to prevent asthma exacerbations: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial.
7. This study investigated whether quadrupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when asthma control deteriorates could reduce the number of acute exacerbations of asthma requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids. The study found that quadrupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid appears to reduce the number of exacerbations requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids, although the primary outcome did not reach statistical significance. The findings suggest that this policy could be beneficial and further investigation is warranted.

Abstract title: Doubling daily inhaled corticosteroid dose is ineffective in mild to moderately severe attacks of asthma in adults.
8. This study compared the effectiveness of doubling existing daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose with maintaining usual ICS dose and usual daily ICS dose accompanied by oral steroids (OS) during mild and moderately severe exacerbations of asthma in adults. Results showed that OS was superior to maintaining usual ICS or doubling ICS dose, with only 5 (26%) failures compared to 12 (63%) and 11 (61%) respectively. Increasing age and the presence of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) were predictive of failure with OS. Side-effects were more commonly reported with OS than doubling ICS or maintaining usual ICS. The study concluded that doubling daily ICS dose is not an effective therapy for mild to moderately severe exacerbations of asthma in adults. Success may depend on achieved ICS dose and oral steroids are effective, but side-effects are common.","The evidence suggests that increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids at the onset of an exacerbation of asthma is ineffective and should not be included in asthma self management plans.

Abstract title: Efficiency of the modified Sims maternal position in the rotation of persistent occiput posterior position during labor: A randomized clinical trial.
1. This study aimed to determine if the modified Sims position on the side of the fetal spine increases the rotation to an occiput anterior position in women with epidural analgesia and a fetus in persistent occiput posterior (POP) position during labor. Results showed that the rotation to occiput anterior occurred in 50.8% of cases in the Sims group, compared to 21.7% in the free position group (P = .001). Additionally, the rate of vaginal deliveries was higher in the Sims group than the free position group (84.7% vs 68.3%, P = .035). The modified Sims position appears to be an effective and noninvasive intervention which increases the chance of rotation to occiput anterior, and decreases the rate of cesarean deliveries.

2. This study evaluated the efficacy of the hands and knees position during the first stage of labour to facilitate the rotation of the fetal head to the occiput anterior position. It found that this position did not have a statistically significant effect in achieving this goal, but it did increase the comfort level of women.

3. This randomized clinical trial is currently underway in the Geneva University Hospitals, Switzerland, to evaluate the efficacy of maternal postures in the management of the occipito-posterior fetal head position during the first stage of labour. The trial will involve 438 women with a fetal head in OP position, confirmed by sonography. The main outcome measure is the position of the fetal head, diagnosed by ultrasound one hour after randomisation. If the technique is found to be effective, it would reduce the physical and psychological consequences of complications at birth related to persistent OP position.

Abstract title: Factors affecting rotation of occiput posterior position during the first stage of labor.
4. This study sought to identify factors associated with rotation of fetal head from occiput posterior to occiput anterior position during the first stage of labor. It was found that excessive gestational weight gain, macrosomia, direct occiput posterior position, and prelabor rupture of membranes were negatively associated with fetal head rotation. The only factor found to be positively associated with fetal head rotation was oxytocin administration. Further studies should be conducted to assess the risks and benefits of oxytocin utilization for managing labor with a fetus in occiput posterior position.

Abstract title: Lateral asymmetric decubitus position for the rotation of occipito-posterior positions: multicenter randomized controlled trial EVADELA.
5. This study evaluated whether a lateral asymmetric decubitus posture could facilitate rotation of a fetal head from occiput posterior to occiput anterior positions. 322 women in labor with a term fetus confirmed to be in cephalic posterior position were randomly assigned to either the intervention (lateral asymmetric decubitus) or control (dorsal recumbent) group. Results showed that 1 hour after random assignment and at complete dilation, occiput anterior rates were similar between groups, as well as cesarean delivery rates, speed of cervical dilation, pain assessment, and women's satisfaction. The study concluded that lateral asymmetric decubitus posture did not facilitate rotation of the fetal head, but further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of other maternal postures.

Abstract title: Assessment of Pulmonary Hypertension in Lung Transplantation Candidates: Correlation of Doppler Echocardiography With Right Heart Catheterization.
1. This study evaluated the feasibility of Doppler echocardiography (DE) for measuring pulmonary artery pressure in lung transplantation candidates, and compared its performance characteristics with Right Heart Catheterization (RHC). Out of the 103 candidates, DE was successful in estimating pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) in 92 (89%), and there was a positive correlation between PASP estimated by DE and measured by RHC (r = 0.585). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of PASP estimation for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension were found to be 85%, 67%, 87%, and 61%, respectively. This suggests that DE is an acceptable method for measuring pulmonary pressures in lung transplantation candidates.

Abstract title: Diagnosis of portopulmonary hypertension in candidates for liver transplantation: a prospective study.
2. Doppler echocardiography is a reliable tool for detecting portopulmonary hypertension, but right heart catheterization is recommended for confirming it. The mean pulmonary artery pressure can increase after evaluation, meaning portopulmonary hypertension can develop during the waitlist period, so it must be monitored.

Abstract title: Accuracy of Doppler-echocardiographic mean pulmonary artery pressure for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension.
3. DE measurement of sPAP has been questioned as a valid way of diagnosing pulmonary hypertension (PH). This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of mPAP for the diagnosis of PH. Results showed that mPAP had a better correlation with RHC than sPAP and a cut-off value of 25.5 mmHg was found to be highly accurate for diagnosis. This value was validated in an independent cohort, showing excellent sensitivity and specificity. It was concluded that mPAP is a useful tool for initial diagnosis of PH and can help avoid unnecessary RHC.

Abstract title: Reliability of noninvasive assessment of systolic pulmonary artery pressure by Doppler echocardiography compared to right heart catheterization: analysis in a large patient population.
4. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of noninvasive assessment of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) via Doppler echocardiography compared to invasive measurements in a large patient population. Results showed a strong correlation between the two methods (r=0.87, P<0.0001) and good sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy for a PAP cut-off value of 36 mm Hg. The findings suggest that Doppler echocardiography is a reliable method for the assessment of PAP and for noninvasively diagnosing pulmonary hypertension in patients with cardiac diseases.

Abstract title: Assessment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with systemic sclerosis: comparison of noninvasive tests with results of right-heart catheterization.
5. In this study, forty-nine patients with systemic sclerosis were evaluated for suspected pulmonary hypertension. Right-heart catheterization was used to identify those with the condition. Three noninvasive tests,Doppler echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and pulmonary function tests, were also used to assess for the presence of pulmonary hypertension. The results showed that Doppler echocardiography had the highest specificity, positive predictive value, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, making it the most useful of the noninvasive tests. However, due to the low sensitivity of noninvasive testing, right-heart catheterization should remain the gold standard for assessing for pulmonary hypertension in systemic sclerosis patients.

Results showed strong correlation between both RVSPchin and RVSPbeard with invasive PASP and between PVRchin and PVRbeard. Accuracy of noninvasive measurement of right heart pressures was increased using the ""chin"" in estimation of both RVSP and PVR, with optimal cut-offs for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension being 2.8 m/s (sensitivity 93%, specificity 87%) and 3.2 m/s (sensitivity 91%, specificity 82%), respectively.

Abstract title: Estimation of pulmonary pressures and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension by Doppler echocardiography: a retrospective comparison of routine echocardiography and invasive hemodynamics.
7. This retrospective study analyzed the records of 310 patients who underwent both hemodynamic and echocardiographic tests within a single hospitalization period. It found that Doppler echocardiography was strongly correlated with right heart catheterization when measuring systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). When targeting a mean pulmonary pressure of 25 mm Hg for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) on right heart catheterization, Doppler echocardiography had a strong association with PH diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 83%, and accuracy of 86%. When the examination intervals were less than two days, the sensitivity and specificity increased to 89%. These results demonstrate that Doppler echocardiography is a reliable primary noninvasive tool for PH evaluation in the real-world practice of a conventional echocardiography department.

8. Doppler-derived systolic PAP (sPAPECHO) and tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG) can be used to screen for pulmonary hypertension (PH). This study used ROC curve analysis to find the optimal sPAPECHO and TRPG cutoffs for detecting PH, which were 41 mmHg and 36 mmHg, respectively. These results provide useful information for screening patients for PH and recommending further investigations on PH.

Abstract title: Multi-view approach for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension using transthoracic echocardiography.
9. This study evaluated 65 patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension through echocardiography and right heart catheterization. Results showed that imaging from multiple ultrasound views improved accuracy of diagnosis, with 87% sensitivity and 91% specificity for correct diagnosis of PH. Additional imaging from atypical views changed the overall peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity in 32% of the patients, and changed the diagnosis of PH in 11%. Therefore, a multiple-view approach may be recommended for more accurate assessment of patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension.

Abstract title: Bottle-blowing in hospital-treated patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
1. A study was carried out to investigate whether bottle-blowing has any positive effects on patients with pneumonia. A total of 145 adults with untreated community-acquired pneumonia were randomized into three groups, with one group being asked to blow bubbles in a bottle containing 10 cm water through a plastic tube 20 times on 10 occasions daily. The results showed that hospital stay was significantly shorter in the group which practiced bottle-blowing, with the mean number of days being 3.9. Additionally, the number of days with fever was also lowest in this group, although the difference was not statistically significant. No significant differences were observed in terms of CRP, PEF, VC, FEV1, or diffusion capacity. The findings suggest that intensive bottle-blowing can shorten the hospital stay in patients with pneumonia, though the mechanism remains unclear.

2. This randomized clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of chest physiotherapy and intermittent positive-pressure breathing in the treatment of pneumonia. 54 patients with a compatible clinical history and x-ray confirmation were divided into two groups and given similar antibiotic therapy. The treatment group received chest physiotherapy and intermittent positive-pressure breathing with racemic epinephrine every 4 hours. No significant difference was found in duration of fever, extent of radiographic clearing, duration of hospital stay and mortality between the control and treatment groups, suggesting that chest physiotherapy and intermittent positive-pressure breathing did not hasten the resolution of pneumonia.

5. The Multicenter Osteopathic Pneumonia Study in the Elderly (MOPSE) conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of OMT as an adjunctive treatment for older adults hospitalized for pneumonia. Subgroup analyses of the study found that OMT reduced length of stay in adults aged 50-74 and in-hospital mortality rates in adults aged 75 and over. Additionally, OMT reduced length of stay and in-hospital mortality rates in patients with more severe pneumonia and light touch treatment reduced in-hospital mortality rates in adults aged 75 and over compared to conventional care only.

Abstract title: Efficacy of osteopathic manipulation as an adjunctive treatment for hospitalized patients with pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial.
6. The Multicenter Osteopathic Pneumonia Study in the Elderly (MOPSE) is a registered, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) as an adjunctive treatment in elderly patients with pneumonia. 406 subjects aged >/= 50 years were randomized to conventional care only, light-touch treatment, or OMT groups and received conventional treatment for pneumonia. Intention-to-treat analysis found no significant differences between groups; however, per-protocol analysis found a significant reduction in median length of hospital stay, duration of intravenous antibiotics, and death or respiratory failure for the OMT group when compared to the conventional care only group. These results suggest that OMT may be beneficial as an adjunctive treatment for pneumonia in the elderly, and further study is warranted.

7. In a study of 286 severe pneumonia patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the curative effect of bronchoalveolar lavage with fiberoptic bronchoscopy combined with vibration sputum drainage compared to bronchoalveolar lavage alone. The results showed that the combination treatment improved respiratory function, reduced inflammation, increased sputum excretion, shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, but did not significantly reduce mortality.","
The evidence suggests that chest physiotherapy and intermittent positive-pressure breathing may not hasten the resolution of pneumonia in adults. Additionally, studies have shown that Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment may reduce the duration of oral antibiotic use and length of hospital stay in elderly adults with pneumonia. Finally, the combination of bronchoalveolar lavage with fiberoptic bronchoscopy and vibration sputum drainage was found to improve respiratory function, reduce inflammation, and shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay.",There is not enough evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions,The intervention has a marginal or insignificant comparative benefits,Agree,"[{""end"": 577, ""text"": "" Finally, the combination of bronchoalveolar lavage with fiberoptic bronchoscopy and vibration sputum drainage was found to improve respiratory function, reduce inflammation, and shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay."", ""start"": 328, ""labels"": [""1""]}]",Agree,196,
44,"Results from this review suggest that MT as 'add on' treatment to standard care can lead to moderate reductions in substance craving and can increase motivation for treatment/change for people with SUDs receiving treatment in detoxification and short-term rehabilitation settings. Greater reduction in craving is associated with MT lasting longer than a single session. We have moderate-to-low confidence in our findings as the included studies were downgraded in certainty due to imprecision, and most included studies were conducted by the same researcher in the same detoxification unit, which considerably impacts the transferability of findings.","Study title: Music therapy for people with substance use disorders

Abstract title: Effects of music therapy on change readiness and craving in patients on a detoxification unit.
1. This study examined the effects of a rockumentary music therapy intervention, verbal therapy, and recreational music therapy on readiness to change and craving in 141 detoxification unit patients. Results showed that participants in the rockumentary and recreational music therapy conditions had higher means for readiness to change than those in the verbal therapy condition. Although not significant, participants in both music therapy conditions tended to have lower mean craving scores than those in the verbal therapy condition. Furthermore, participants in both music therapy conditions also tended to have slightly higher mean scores for motivation to change, perception of helpfulness, and perception of enjoyment than those in the verbal therapy conditions. Limitations, suggestions for future research, and implications for clinical practice are discussed.

Abstract title: Effects of group songwriting on motivation and readiness for treatment on patients in detoxification: a randomized wait-list effectiveness study.
2. This study investigated the effects of a single group songwriting session on motivation and readiness for treatment in patients on a detoxification unit. Results showed that the experimental group had higher means in motivation and readiness for treatment than the control group, and emerging themes from patient-composed songs included ""action,"" ""emotions and feelings,"" ""change,"" ""reflection,"" ""admission,"" and ""responsibility."" It appears that group songwriting can be an effective intervention for these patients. Implications for clinical practice and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Abstract title: Effects of music therapy on drug avoidance self-efficacy in patients on a detoxification unit: a three-group randomized effectiveness study.
3. This study explored the effects of music therapy compared to verbal therapy and a wait-list control group on drug avoidance self-efficacy in 131 participants undergoing detoxification. Results showed that although there was no significant difference in drug avoidance self-efficacy between the groups, participants in the music therapy group tended to have the highest mean scores. Posttest comments from participants supported the use of music therapy and verbal therapy, with two specifically noting a change in their initial skepticism. Further research is recommended to further explore the potential of music therapy for substance abuse rehabilitation.

Abstract title: Effects of lyric analysis interventions on treatment motivation in patients on a detoxification unit: a randomized effectiveness study.
4. This study evaluated the effect of lyric analysis interventions on treatment motivation in a single-session wait-list control design with 104 participants. Results showed that experimental participants had higher treatment motivation than control participants in terms of problem recognition, desire for help, treatment readiness, and total motivation. There was no difference between the two lyric analysis interventions used. The findings suggest that a single group-based music therapy lyric analysis session can be an effective psychosocial treatment intervention to enhance treatment motivation in patients on a detoxification unit.

Abstract title: Effects of Live and Educational Music Therapy on Working Alliance and Trust With Patients on Detoxification Unit: A Four-Group Cluster-Randomized Trial.
5. This study investigated the effects of live versus recorded and educational versus recreational music therapy interventions on working alliance and trust with patients on a detoxification unit. 130 participants were cluster randomized to one of four conditions: Live educational music therapy, recorded educational music therapy, education without music, or recreational music therapy. The results showed no statistically significant between-group differences in any of the measures, although a higher number of patients and research participants attended live educational music therapy sessions. Implications for clinical practice, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Abstract title: Effects of a Single Lyric Analysis Intervention on Withdrawal and Craving With Inpatients on a Detoxification Unit: A Cluster-Randomized Effectiveness Study.
6. This randomized effectiveness study examined the effects of single-session group lyric analysis interventions on withdrawal and craving in patients on a detoxification unit. Results showed that while participants in the experimental condition had lower withdrawal and craving means than participants in the control condition, these differences were not significant. Furthermore, familiarity with the song was not related to withdrawal or craving. The study suggests that group-based lyric analysis interventions may be effective for temporarily relieving withdrawal and craving in patients on a detoxification unit, but further research is needed.

Abstract title: Quantitative comparison of group-based music therapy experiences in adults with substance use disorder on a detoxification unit: a three-group cluster-randomized study.
7. This study examined the impact of three group-based single-session interventions in adults with substance use disorder on a detoxification unit: Recreational Music Therapy (RMT), Educational Lyric Analysis for Illness Management and Recovery (ELA-IMR) and Educational Songwriting for Illness Management and Recovery (ESW-IMR). Results showed that the ELA-IMR and ESW-IMR conditions had higher scores for the sharing of emotions and experiences subscale and the total group experience than the RMT condition. These findings suggest that educational music therapy interventions can positively contribute to recovery-based objectives and the group experience in adults with substance use disorder.

Abstract title: Songwriting to Target State Shame, Guilt, and Pride in Adults with Substance Use Disorder on a Detoxification Unit: A Cluster-Randomized Study.
8. This study examined the effects of a single songwriting intervention on state shame, guilt, and pride in adults with SUD on a detoxification unit. The results showed that there was no significant difference in state shame or guilt between the songwriting and control conditions. However, participants in the songwriting condition reported higher levels of state pride compared to the control group. This suggests that group-based blues songwriting interventions may be an effective way of addressing shame and guilt in people with SUD.","The evidence suggests that music therapy, such as rockumentary, recreational, lyric analysis, and songwriting, may be beneficial for people with substance use disorders in terms of increasing readiness to change, reducing craving, enhancing motivation and readiness for treatment, and increasing drug avoidance self-efficacy.

Abstract title: Effect of Negative Pressure Therapy on Open Abdomen Treatments. Prospective Randomized Study With Two Commercial Negative Pressure Systems.
1. This study compared the effects of two negative pressure dressings, AB-Thera and Suprasorb CNP, on patients with secondary peritonitis. Results showed that there was no significant difference between the two systems in terms of Mannheim peritonitis Index, age, gender, mean duration of treatment, WBC, CRP, and abdominal closure rate. Suprasorb CNP System collected twice more fluid than AB-Thera and decreased PCT on a faster rate. In addition, there were no significant difference in closure rate and four patients (11%) developed enteric fistula. The results suggest that both systems are efficient and safe for open abdominal treatment.

2. The present study investigated the use of two different temporary closure methods, the vacuum assisted closure (VAC) and Bogota bag techniques, in 40 patients with abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Results showed that the decrease in incision width was significantly faster in the VAC group than in the Bogota group and the decrease in abdominal pressure was also significantly lower on day 14 in the VAC group. 12 patients (30%) died during the study, with 5 (12%) in the VAC group and 7 (17.5%) in the Bogota bag group.

1. This study found that bamlanivimab, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2, significantly reduced the incidence of COVID-19 among residents and staff of 74 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in the United States with at least 1 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 index case. Five deaths attributed to COVID-19 were reported by day 57, all of which occurred in the placebo group. Adverse events were also reported, with the most common being urinary tract infection and hypertension.

1. This study of 90 female patients with overactive bladder (OAB) found that acupuncture was an effective treatment option, creating a significant difference in symptom scores and quality of life between the acupuncture and placebo groups. Urine nerve growth factor (NGF) levels decreased after treatment in each group and were higher in the acupuncture group when 8 patients who did not achieve sufficient symptomatic improvement were included. Thus, acupuncture may be considered a viable treatment option for those with contraindications to anticholinergic treatment.

2. This pilot study was a double-blind, randomized, clinical trial that examined the feasibility of recruiting women with urge and mixed urinary incontinence into a study and performing the planned procedures to assess the efficacy of acupuncture in reducing UI and improving general health-related and disease-specific quality of life. Nine women between the ages of 44 and 66 were recruited and randomly assigned to either a true acupuncture or sham acupuncture group. At the end of 6 weeks, the true acupuncture group had a mean 63.30% (median = 65.99%) reduction in daytime accidents/day at 1 week postacupuncture and 67.47% reduction (median = 75.76%) at 4 weeks postacupuncture. The sham acupuncture group had a mean 18.88% (median = 19.64%) reduction in daytime accidents at 1 week and 16.67% (median = 0%) at 4 weeks post-sham acupuncture. There were no significant differences in changes in quality of life scores. The results of this study suggest that there is a need for further research on the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of UI in women, as well as the feasibility of performing study procedures and the use of a sham needle as a placebo.
