To evaluate the potential of advanced platelet-rich fibrin (A-PRF) as a regenerative biomaterial for bone regeneration and postoperative sequelae after impacted third molar extractions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a split-mouth, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. A total of 10 female patients in King Abdulaziz University Dental Hospital with bilateral impacted third molars were recruited into the study. Surgical extractions were performed on both sides of the mandible. Randomization was done by a coin toss; A-PRF was placed on the one side while the other side did not receive any intervention. Each patient acted as their own control. Both the patients and the investigators were blinded about the A-PRF side. The outcome on periodontal regeneration was made measuring pocket depth (PD), gum recession (GR), and clinical attachment level (CAL) before and at 1- and 3-months postoperatively. Pain, swelling, and healing were assessed on the 7th postoperative day.  p  value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
An estimated 10 patients completed the study. There were no significant differences in PD, CAL, and GR between the two groups at any time point, although the data obtained were slightly favoring the A-PRF. However, a statistically significant reduction in pain and swelling was observed in the A-PRF group compared to the controls ( p  < 0.05).

CONCLUSION
The findings of this study demonstrate A-PRF as a potential biomaterial for lessening the severity of pain and swelling after third molar surgery. Long-term trials with a larger sample size and more methodically sound assessment tools are needed to obtain more meaningful results on periodontal regeneration.

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Placement of A-PRF clot in the extraction socket could lessen postoperative pain and increase patient comfort after third molar extraction.

While no clinical adverse effects were observed, 2 patients developed hypertriglyceridemia and 1 patient developed hypoglycemia. The results suggest that KD is a feasible treatment for TBI patients and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is warranted to further explore its efficacy.","BACKGROUND
Traumatic Brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. Ketogenic diet (KD) has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in acute brain injury, but limited data about its use in adult TBI patients is available. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of ketogenic diet (KD) for adult TBI patients in the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit (NSICU).

METHODS
TBI patients admitted to NSICU between June 2019 to March 2021 were enrolled in this single-center, open label, single-arm prospective intervention study. The primary feasibility outcome was achievement of ketosis (detection and maintenance of serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOB) levels above normal); secondary outcomes included laboratory and clinical adverse effects related to KD.

RESULTS
10 adults with TBI with Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS)-Head ≥3 and ventriculostomy catheter to monitor intracranial pressure met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were placed on KD. Mean age was 47 years, and all patients were male. Eight out of 10 patients achieved ketosis within mean 2.2 days. KD was initiated within 8-33 h (average 23 h) of hospital admission. No clinical adverse effects were noted, 2 patients developed hypertriglyceridemia and 1 patient developed hypoglycemia. Serum glucose showed a decreasing trend in most patients.

CONCLUSIONS
This pilot study shows that KD is feasible in the management of TBI patients. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is justified to further understand the optimal serum BOB levels, dose and duration of KD in TBI and its effect on the outcome. CLINICALTRIALS.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 585 nm Q-switched laser in the treatment of acne inflammatory lesions and postinflammatory erythema.

METHODS
A total of 25 patients with moderate facial acne, symmetrical distribution of inflammatory lesions and postinflammatory erythema on both sides of the face, were enrolled. Among the 25 patients, 22 patients completed all the treatment and evaluation, and 3 patients were lost to follow-up. 585 nm Q-switched laser was used on a randomly selected side of the face for three times of treatment at a 2 week interval. The evaluations were made before each treatment, 2 and 4 weeks after the last treatment, therefore the evaluation time points were before the treatment, weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively, for a total of 5 times. Acne severity was assessed using the investigator' s global assessment (IGA) score, and erythema severity was assessed using the investigator' s subjective erythema score and narrow-spectrum reflectance spectrophotometer at each follow-up.

RESULTS
After 3 times of treatment, there was statistically significant difference between the IGA score in week 8 and before treatment on both sides( Z =2.64,  P  < 0.01;  Z =2.67,  P  < 0.01). There was no significant difference in IGA score between the treatment side and the control side before treatment and in week 8 ( P =0.59,  P =0.26). There was statistically significant difference between the investiga-tor' s subjective erythema score in week 8 and before treatment on the treatment side( Z =4.24,  P  < 0.01), while no significant difference was showed on the control side( Z =1.73,  P =0.08). In week 8, the investigator's subjective erythema score of the treatment side was lower than that of the control side ( Z =3.61,  P  < 0.01). The erythema index of the treatment side was significantly decreased at 5 time points ( P  < 0.01), and the index decreased significantly in week 8 compared with the index before treatment ( P  < 0.01), while the erythema index of the control side was not significantly different at 5 time points. The treatment related adverse events included erythema and edema after treatment and pain during treatment, the severity was mild to moderate, which resolved spontaneously within 1 to 3 days. Nine patients were very satisfied with the treatment, 7 patients were satisfied, and 6 patients considered average.

CONCLUSION
585 nm Q-switched laser has some effect in the treatment of postinflammatory erythema, and it ensures good tolerance and safety. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment side and the control side on the improvement of acne inflammatory lesions.

Diabetes type 2 is a chronic hyperglycemia, its control depends on the patient's Self-efficacy and self-care activities. Therapeutic Patient Education (TPE) enhances the patient involvement and engagement in managing chronic diseases effectively by improving the health outcomes. It helps the patients developing competencies of self-care, coping with diabetes and controlling glycaemia.

OBJECTIVE
The objectives of this study are to assess the effects of TPE in type 2 Diabetic patients in Lebanon on their glycemic control, Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale (DMSES) and their self-care activities (Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities SDSCA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 100 diabetic patients (50 experimental, 50 control) were recruited from a primary care center according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The experimental group followed the TPE by a multidisciplinary team. Glycemic control, DMSES and SDSCA were measured at baseline and after three months. The experimental group (EG) was followed up by phone calls every two weeks after the TPE.

RESULTS
The results revealed that the experimental group showed significant improvement at the level of self-efficacy in managing their disease concerning general nutrition, specific nutrition, control of glycaemia, physical activity, weight control and medical control (α<0.01); the total score of DMSES had significantly increased from 5.02 to 8.28 in the EG (α<0.01) compared to the control group (CG) that has decreased from 4.91 to 4.85 (α<0.05). Moreover, regarding the SDSCA of the EG, the results highlighted that the activities related to general diet, specific diet, physical exercise, foot care, the measurement of glycaemia and the medication-taking had significantly improved (α<0.05), whereas the CG didn't improve his self-care activities (α>0.05). In addition, the glycemic control HbA1c had improved in the EG after the intervention compared to the CG.

CONCLUSION
The findings of this study demonstrated that Therapeutic Patient Education is efficient in contributing to better glycemic control, better DMSES and SDSCA. Health professionals are best suited to help diabetic patients improve their self-efficacy in managing diabetes, controlling glycemia and improving their self-care.

The study aims to examine the effect of peer education on the decision to quit smoking, factors that encourage smoking, self-efficacy, addiction, and behavior change in students who apply to the Youth Friendly Center to quit smoking.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
This research is a Randomized Controlled Trials study. The experimental group consisted of students who were enrolled in the peer education course (n=759). The control group has consisted of students (n=1095) who did not enroll in this course.

RESULTS
Participants in the experimental group to quit smoking, more than the control group (p>0,01). The addiction level of the participants in the experimental group, less than the participants in the control group (p>0,01). According to the scores of the participants in the control group of the participants in the experimental group, the factors that trigger smoking, and the benefit sub-dimension scores in the Decision Balance Scale were low.

9,"Currently, there are no robust criteria to objectively determine the failure of non-surgical treatment or to establish the indications for surgery in acute ASBO.",A randomized clinical trial is being proposed to evaluate how procalcitonin can help distinguish patients with uncomplicated acute adhesion-related small bowel obstruction who would be successful with conservative management from those who require surgery. The trial will use a 1:1 cluster-randomized design and will include adults who are able to provide written informed consent. The results of the trial may help simplify or clarify the management algorithm in these cases. The trial is registered at clinical trials under the reference: NCT03905239.,"BACKGROUND
Acute adhesion-related small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common digestive emergency, accounting for 1 to 3% of all digestive emergencies. The efficacy of conservative management in this setting is a subject of debate, as it may delay the decision to perform surgery and increase the frequency of bowel resection (e.g., in the presence of bowel necrosis) or, in contrast, prompt an excessive number of unnecessary laparotomies. Thus, the decision to perform surgery is difficult. We propose that the introduction of the procalcitonin (PCT)-based algorithm improves the quality of the management of patients with ASBO by aiding the decision of whether or not to perform surgery.

METHODS
This is a 1:1 cluster-randomized clinical trial (use of algorithm: no algorithm) using an independent computer to ensure that investigators cannot interfere with the randomization. Each cluster will correspond to one investigating center. All patients in a center will be managed in the same way. Before randomization, each principal investigator will provide a commitment to participate in the study to avoid the risk of ""empty clusters"". The patients included will constitute two parallel arms (use of algorithm versus no algorithm), with no expected crossover between arms. The inclusion criteria are being an adult with uncomplicated acute ASBO (i.e., absence of fever, abdominal pain and distension, nausea and/or vomiting, and the absence of gas and/or stool, in conjunction with a contrast-enhanced CT scan, for patients with previous abdominal surgery) who is able to express consent with a signed written informed consent form. Patients with complicated acute ASBO (strangulation or peritonitis) will be excluded.

DISCUSSION
There is an ongoing debate on the management of uncomplicated ASBO. The main points are to avoid a surgery if it is unnecessary and to avoid delayed surgery if it is necessary. Currently, there are no robust criteria to objectively determine the failure of non-surgical treatment or to establish the indications for surgery in acute ASBO. Our team proposes the use of procalcitonin (PCT) to help distinguish patients for whom conservative management is likely to be successful from those for whom surgical management is required. The results from a randomized control trial could help in the selection of patients through clear inclusion and exclusion criteria and simplify or clarify the management algorithm. In conclusion, PCT may be useful in evaluating the proper strategy for ASBO. Trial registration The trial is registered at clinical trials under the reference: NCT03905239.
","Acute adhesion-related small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common emergency in the digestive system and doctors don't always know the best way to treat it.

10,Affective dysregulation had the highest and avoidance the lowest centrality.,"This study explored the complex interaction between ICD-11 CPTSD symptom clusters and post-migration living difficulties in treatment-seeking Afghan asylum seekers and refugees. Results showed direct links between CPTSD symptom clusters and PMLDs, with re-experiencing and affective dysregulation having the strongest ties to PMLDs. These findings suggest that targeting these domains in treatment approaches might facilitate treatment response and reduce the burden caused by PMLDs.","BACKGROUND
Psychological distress due to the ongoing war, violence, and persecution is particularly common among Afghan asylum seekers and refugees. In addition, individuals face a variety of post-migration living difficulties (PMLDs). Complex posttraumatic stress symptoms are among the most common mental health problems in this population, and were associated with the overall burden of PMLDs. The complex interplay of posttraumatic symptoms has been investigated from a network perspective in previous studies. However, individuals are embedded in and constantly react to the environment, which makes it important to include external factors in network models to better understand the etiology and maintaining factors of posttraumatic mental health problems. PMLDs are a major risk factor for posttraumatic distress and considering their impact in interventions might improve response rates. However, the interaction of these external factors with posttraumatic psychopathological distress is not yet fully understood. Thus, we aimed to illuminate the complex interaction between PMLDs and CPTSD symptom clusters.

OBJECTIVE
The main objective is the exploration of the network structure and the complex interplay of ICD-11 CPTSD symptom clusters and distinct forms of PMLDs.

METHOD
The symptom clusters of CPTSD and PMLDs were collected within a randomised controlled trial among 93 treatment-seeking Afghan asylum seekers and refugees via a fully structured face-to-face and interpreter assisted interview. Using a network analytical approach, we explored the complex associations and network centrality of the CPTSD symptom clusters and the PMLD factors: discrimination & socio-economical living conditions, language acquisition & barriers, family concerns, and residence insecurity.

RESULTS
The results suggest direct links within and between the constructs (CPTSD, PMLD). Almost all PMLD factors were interrelated and associated to CPTSD, family concerns was the only isolated variable. The CPTSD symptom cluster re-experiencing and the PMLD factor language acquisition & barriers connected the two constructs. Affective dysregulation had the highest and avoidance the lowest centrality.

CONCLUSIONS
Re-experiencing and affective dysregulation have the strongest ties to PMLDs. Thus, these domains might explain the strong association of posttraumatic psychopathology with PLMDs and, consequently, prioritization of these domains in treatment approaches might both facilitate treatment response and reduce burden caused by PMLDs.

Ozone attenuated the myocardial injury and oxidative stress caused by aortic ischemia-reperfusion.","BACKGROUND
This study aims to investigate the effect of ozone on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury occurring after occlusion - reperfusion of infrarenal abdominal aorta in rats.

METHODS
Thirty-two Wistar albino rats (weighing 200-250 g) were randomized into four equal groups. The control (sham) group underwent laparotomy and dissection of the infrarenal abdominal aorta without occlusion. Intraperitoneal ozone was applied for 10 days 1 mg/kg/day in the control+ozone group. Afterwards, control+ozone group underwent laparotomy and dissection of the infrarenal abdominal aorta without occlusion. Aortic ischemia-reperfusion and aortic ischemia-reperfusion+ozone groups underwent dissection of the infrarenal abdominal aorta, followed by achieving ischemia and reperfusion by cross-clamping the infrarenal abdominal aorta for 60 minutes and removing the cross-clamp for 60 minutes, respectively. The tissue levels of malondialdehyde and activity levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and myeloperoxidase were measured in the myocardial specimens. The tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and troponin-I levels were measured in the plasma. A histopathological examination of the myocardial specimens was undertaken.

RESULTS
Biochemical analysis showed that aortic ischemia-reperfusion significantly increased (p<0.05 vs. control) while ozone significantly decreased (p<0.05 vs. aortic ischemia-reperfusion) the myocardial tissue levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase and level of plasma troponin-I. Histologically, in the aortic ischemia-reperfusion group, myocardial disorganization, myofiber swelling and myofiber eosinophilia in the myocardial tissue samples were significantly increased compared to the control group (p<0.05 vs. control). However, histopathological changes in the aortic ischemia-reperfusion+ozone group decreased compared to the aortic ischemia-reperfusion group.

CONCLUSION
The results of this experimental study indicate that ozone attenuates myocardial injury and oxidative stress that develop after infrarenal aortic ischemia-reperfusion through three markers; (i) decreased tissue superoxide dismutase and catalase levels, (ii) d ecreased p lasma t roponin-I l evels, a nd (iii) reduced histopathological changes, albeit not statistically significant.

To compare the basic airway and the advanced airway with the supraglottic device I-Gel®, by means of capnography during intermediate CPR.

DESIGN
Randomized experimental pilot study by groups.

SETTING
Out-hospital care basic life support units on the Island of Mallorca.

PARTICIPANTS
Adults attended after cardiorespiratory arrest of non-traumatic origin.

INTERVENTIONS
Advanced airway management during instrumental CPR with I-Gel® or basic CPR with bag-valve-mask, under capnographic monitoring.

MAIN MEASUREMENTS
Capnometric levels obtained according to the device used, number of insertions of the I-Gel®, cases without achieving correct insertion/ventilation by branches, achievement of ROSC in CPR and number of hospital live admissions.

RESULTS
Twenty-three cases were recruited for analysis. The insertion success rate of the I-Gel® was 92.9% at the first attempt, the mean capnometric values were 16.3mmHg in the control group and 27.4% in the intervention group. 34.8% (n=8) of the patients achieved spontaneous circulation recovery at some point and 26.1% (n=6) were admitted to hospital alive. The survival analysis, taking into account the arrival of the unit and the first minute of ventilations recorded together with the variable hospital admission, suggests a certain trend of greater survival in the intervention branch (P=.066).

13,"The bacterial community changed significantly after the use of sodium hyaluronate eye drops (with or without preservatives), whether within individuals or between individuals in different groups ( P  < 0.05, PERMANOVA).","This study examined the effects of sodium hyaluronate eye drops (with or without preservatives) on the bacterial community of the ocular surface in 16 healthy adults. Results showed that the bacterial community changed significantly after the use of sodium hyaluronate eye drops, and different dosage forms of sodium hyaluronate eye drops significantly decreased the relative abundance of two bacteria, Flavobacterium caeni and Deinococcus antarcticus (P < 0.05). The study concluded that, regardless of the presence of benzalkonium chloride, sodium hyaluronate eye drops can alter the bacterial community on the ocular surface.","Purpose
This study aimed to determine the composition and diversity of bacterial communities on the ocular surface before and after the intervention with sodium hyaluronate eye drops (with or without preservatives) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
Methods
Sixteen healthy adults were randomly divided into two groups and treated with sodium hyaluronate eye drops with or without preservatives for 2 weeks. The individuals used the same artificial tears in both eyes. The microbial samples from the conjunctival sac of each participant were collected at baseline and 2 weeks after intervention. The diversity and taxonomic differences among different groups before and after intervention were compared by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.
Results
The similarity in the binocular microbial community was high in 1 of the 16 volunteers (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity score < 0.3). At the genus level, 11 bacteria were detected in all samples with an average relative abundance of more than 1%. The bacterial community changed significantly after the use of sodium hyaluronate eye drops (with or without preservatives), whether within individuals or between individuals in different groups ( P  < 0.05, PERMANOVA). Different dosage forms of sodium hyaluronate eye drops significantly decreased the relative abundance of  Flavobacterium caeni  and  Deinococcus antarcticus , respectively ( P  < 0.05).
Conclusions

Introduction: yerba mate is a traditional drink consumed in South America, produced from toasted leaves of Ilex paraguariensis. Several studies have demonstrated its lipid-lowering properties due to the presence of polyphenols and saponins. Objective: to analyze the effect of daily yerba mate consumption on the values of serum lipids and body composition in overweight women. Methods: 119 overweight women between 25 and 50 years were divided into three groups: Mate and Diet (MD), Mate without Diet (M), and Water and Diet (AD). For 12 weeks the M and MD groups were supplemented with mate, while the AD and MD groups maintained a hypocaloric food plan. Anthropometric measurements and blood tests (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides) were taken at the beginning and at the end of the study. The statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test or Wilcoxon's test for paired samples and ANOVA (p < 0.05 was considered significant in all cases). Results: total cholesterol decreased in all groups (10.21 mg/dL in MD, 18.29 mg/dL in M, and 17.63 mg/dL in AD, without differences between groups). LDL-cholesterol decreased in both groups with mate (8.07 mg/dL in MD, 16.04 mg/dL in M, without differences between groups) while HDL-cholesterol decreased in M (2.09 mg/dL).

16,Early stage breast cancer patients with relatively lower levels of pretreatment physical fitness have lower odds of achieving an optimal dose of chemotherapy.,"In this study, the association between pre-treatment physical fitness and achieving an optimal relative dose intensity (RDI) of adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage breast cancer patients was investigated. Results showed that lower pre-treatment physical fitness was associated with significantly lower odds of achieving an optimal RDI. However, this association was almost completely mitigated in patients who participated in an exercise intervention during chemotherapy. Thus, clinicians should consider referring patients to supportive exercise programs to improve treatment completion.","INTRODUCTION
An optimal relative dose intensity (RDI) of adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with better survival in patients with breast cancer. Little is known about the role of physical fitness in attaining an adequate RDI in patients with early stage breast cancer. We investigated the association between pre-treatment physical fitness and RDI in this population.

METHODS
We pooled individual patient data from two randomized exercise trials that studied exercise programs in early breast cancer: the PACES (n = 230) and the PACT (N = 204) study. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between pre-treatment fitness and achieving an optimal RDI (≥85%). In addition, we added an interaction term to the model to explore the potential moderating effect of participating in an exercise program.

RESULTS
Data were available for 419 patients (mean age at diagnosis 50.0 ± 8.6 years). In the total sample, lower pre-treatment physical fitness was associated with significantly lower odds of achieving ≥85% RDI: age-adjusted OR 0.66 [95%CI 0.46-0.94]. In patients allocated to the supervised exercise intervention during chemotherapy (n = 173), the association between pretreatment physical fitness and RDI was almost completely mitigated (OR 0.95 (95%CI 0.54-1.56)), while it was more pronounced in patients who received care as usual (n = 172, OR 0.31 (95%CI 0.13-0.63) pinteraction: 0.022).

CONCLUSION
Early stage breast cancer patients with relatively lower levels of pretreatment physical fitness have lower odds of achieving an optimal dose of chemotherapy. Given that physical fitness is modifiable and our results suggest that following a moderate-to-high intensity exercise training during chemotherapy could improve treatment completion, clinicians should not refrain from referring patients to supportive exercise programs because of low fitness.
","This passage is talking about how physical fitness can affect breast cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy.

To comparatively examine the effectiveness and safety of the combination therapy of traditional Chinese medicine formula Bushen-Shugan granule and psychotherapy (BSSG-P) and Chinese herbal medicine Bushen-Shugan granule (BSSG) alone in the treatment of moderate to serious mood disorder in menopausal women.

METHODS
In our previous clinical studies, BSSG-P had been proved to be superior to BSSG, psychological treatment, and placebo in improving mild mood disorder in menopausal women. In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of BSSG-P and BSSG in the treatment of moderate to serious mood disorder. Eighty-five eligible participants, who were diagnosed as menopausal women with moderate to serious mood disorder and categorized as kidney deficiency and liver-qi stagnation pattern, were randomly assigned into two groups and treated with BSSG-P or BSSG.

The participants received indomethacin, ibuprofen or placebo in a randomized order and then underwent Schirmer II lacrimation tests. The results showed no significant differences between the three conditions, suggesting that blocking the reflex may not be the treatment mechanism of indomethacin.","BACKGROUND
Unlike other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, indomethacin has been shown to be highly effective in two forms of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, hemicrania continua and paroxysmal hemicrania and in some forms of idiopathic stabbing headaches. This specificity is unique in the headache field. Previous findings suggest the involvement of the trigeminal autonomic reflex to play an important role in the pathophysiology of these diseases.

METHODS
22 healthy participants were enrolled in a double-blind, three-day within-subject design. The participants received indomethacin, ibuprofen or placebo in a randomized order. After an incubation period of 65 min the baseline lacrimation and the lacrimation during intranasal stimulation evoked by kinetic oscillation stimulation were assessed using Schirmer II lacrimation tests. The lacrimation difference in mm was calculated and compared in a repeated measures ANOVA.

RESULTS
No significant differences were found between the three conditions.

In our study, neither indomethacin nor ibuprofen had an inhibitory effect on the trigeminal autonomic reflex. We suggest that blocking this reflex may not be the treatment mechanism of indomethacin.
","In this study, scientists looked at the effects of two medicines, indomethacin and ibuprofen, on a reflex in the body called the trigeminal autonomic reflex. They asked 22 people to take either indomethacin, ibuprofen, or a placebo (a pretend medicine) and then measured the reflex. The results showed that neither indomethacin nor ibuprofen had any effect on the trigeminal autonomic reflex. This means that blocking this reflex may not be the way that indomethacin works to treat certain headaches.",Strongly agree,"The population is mentioned, and described accurately","The intervention is mentioned, and described accurately","The outcome is mentioned, and described accurately",No omission,No errors,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,"The population is mentioned, and described accurately","The intervention is mentioned, and described accurately","The outcome is mentioned, and described accurately",No omission,No errors,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,All,Strongly agree,121,,,,"This study i think should not be screened by the software, it doesn't have results written (low quality)",,,,,,

This study tries to find evidence for a standardized non-pharmacological strategy delivered through Junior Public Health Nurses (JPHNs) in achieving and maintaining glycemic control among diabetic patients registered with NCD clinics of primary health care settings.  Design:  A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted among adult patients with Diabetes Mellitus attending NCD clinics of primary care settings of South Kerala, India. JPHNs of the intervention group received additional module-based training while standard management continued in the control group. Sequence generation was done by random permuted blocks method and a cluster of 12 patients was selected from each of the 11 settings by computer-generated random numbers. Patients were followed up for 6 months with monthly monitoring of Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS), Post-Prandial Blood Sugar (PPBS), blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), and health-related behaviors. Knowledge and skills/practice of JPHNs were also evaluated. Analysis of Covariance was done to study the final outcome adjusting for the baseline values and a model for glycemic control was predicted using multilevel modeling.  Results:  We analyzed 72 participants in the intervention group and 60 participants in the control group according to the intention-to-treat principle. The intervention was associated with a significant reduction in FBS ( p  < 0.001) and PPBS ( p  < 0.001) adjusting for the baseline values. The achievement of glycemic control was 1.5 (95% CI: 1.05-2.3) times better with intervention and they showed a better trend of maintenance of glycemic control (FBS,  p  = 0.003 and PPBS,  p  = 0.039). Adjusting for clustering and the baseline values, the intervention showed a significant effect on FBS (B = -3.1, SE = 0.57;  p  < 0.001) and PPBS (B = -0.81, SE = 0.3;  p  < 0.001) with time. Drug adherence score ( p  < 0.001), hours of physical activity ( p  < 0.001), BMI ( p  = 0.002), fruit intake ( p  = 0.004), and green leafy vegetable intake ( p  = 0.01) were the major predictors of FBS control. The practice/skills score of the JPHNs significantly improved with intervention ( p  < 0.001) adjusting for baseline values.

Workplace nutrition has been identified as a priority setting that can significantly reduce cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk factors. This study was conducted as a part of the workplace education program to improve nutritional practices and cardiometabolic status in industrial personnel.

METHODS
The present research was a randomized controlled field trial conducted on employees of a regional petrochemical company. The health-related priorities of the program were defined and addressed in the study in which 104 employees with dyslipidemia were randomly divided into two groups of education and control. Data were collected pre- and post-intervention, using valid and reliable multi-session questionnaires on demographic data, nutritional knowledge, and nutritional intake. Anthropometric measures, serum FBS, HbA1C, hs-CRP and homocysteine (Hcy) were assessed in both groups. In the education group, the nutrition program included five educational workshops about healthy nutrition and regular exercise along with educational messages over a 3-month period. The controls did not receive any education during the study.

RESULTS
There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding the baseline variables. The education group significantly improved their nutritional knowledge ( p  < 0.001), dietary intakes ( p  < 0.005), serum FBS (p < 0.001) and Hcy levels (p < 0.001) and anthropometric indices.

24,This study aims to explore the influence of MR technology on the outcomes and strategy planning of robotic surgery for complex renal tumors.,"This study examined the impact of mixed reality technology on robotic surgery outcomes and strategies for complex renal tumors. A total of 92 patients were randomly assigned to the study group and control group. Results showed that MR technology can reduce warm ischemia time, reconstruction time, estimated blood loss, operation time and intraoperative complications compared to the control group. The findings suggest that MR assisted surgery may be beneficial for preoperative planning of complex renal tumors.","OBJECTIVES
Mixed reality (MR) technology has emerged in recent years and allows three-dimensional visualization, multi-angle observation, remote vision, and virtual-real interaction. This study aims to explore the influence of MR technology on the outcomes and strategy planning of robotic surgery for complex renal tumors.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
A total of 92 patients with complex renal tumors were enrolled in this study from June 2018 to June 2020. All patients were diagnosed in our department by magnetic resonance imaging（MRI）. This trial follows CONSORT guidelines and adopts a parallel single blind design and randomizes patients with a random number table. The study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. All surgeries were performed by 3 experienced and high-volume surgeons. The demographic indicators, intraoperative and postoperative complications, renal function outcomes, pathological results, and surgical strategies were recorded. Student's t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum were used to compare continuous variables, and Pearson's chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical variables.

RESULTS
WIT is mainly composed of tumor resection time and reconstruction time, and the reconstruction time accounts for a larger proportion. For urologists treating complex renal tumors, MR technology can help them reduce warm ischemia time (21.3±4.0 vs 23.6±5.9min, P=0.031), reconstruction time (15.4±3.8 vs 17.2±4.2min, P=0.034), estimated blood loss (P=0.044), operation time (125.7±26.3 vs 144.6±27.9min, P=0.001) and intraoperative complications (P=0.030).

CONCLUSIONS
MR assisted surgery can reduce the incidence of intraoperative complications, improve perioperative outcomes, which may be a good preoperative tool for planning complex renal tumors.

To assess the safety and efficacy of hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin delivery 24/7 versus only evening and night (E/N), and on extended 24/7 use, in free-living children with type 1 diabetes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Prepubertal children (n = 122; 49 females/73 males; age, 8.6 ± 1.6 years; diabetes duration, 5.2 ± 2.3 years; insulin pump use, 4.6 ± 2.5 years; HbA1c 7.7% ± 0.7%/61 ± 5 mmol/mol) from four centres were randomized for 24/7 versus E/N activation of the Tandem Control-IQ system for 18 weeks. Afterwards, all children used the activated system 24/7 for 18 more weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent in the 70-180 mg/dL glucose range (TIR).

RESULTS
HCL was active 94.1% and 51.1% of the time in the 24/7 and E/N modes, respectively. TIR from baseline increased more in the 24/7 versus the E/N mode (52.9% ± 9.5% to 67.3% ± 5.6% [+14.4%, 95% CI 12.4%-16.7%] vs. 55.1% ± 10.8% to 64.7% ± 7.0% [+9.6%, 95% CI 7.4%-11.6%]; P = .001). Mean percentage time below range was similarly reduced, from 4.2% and 4.6% to 2.7%, and the mean percentage time above range decreased more in the 24/7 mode (41.9% to 30.0% [-11.9%, 95% CI 9.7%-14.6%] vs. 39.8% to 32.6% [-7.2%, 95% CI 5.0%-9.9%]; P = .007). TIR increased through the whole range of baseline levels and always more with 24/7 use. The results were maintained during the extension phase in those initially on 24/7 use and improved in those with initial E/N use up to those with 24/7 use. Neither ketoacidosis nor severe hypoglycaemia occurred.

CONCLUSIONS
The current study shows the safety and efficacy of the Tandem Control-IQ system in free-living children with type 1 diabetes for both E/N and 24/7 use; 24/7 use shows better outcomes, sustained for up to 36 weeks with no safety issues.

26,Significant reductions were observed in the mean level of fear of falling between baseline and 12 months (p = 0.000).,"This study examined the effectiveness of the Otago Exercise Programme (OEP) in reducing the fear of falling in non-institutionalised people aged 65-80 in Spain. 498 participants were enrolled, 67% of whom were female with an average age of 71.81 years. Following the five weekly OEP sessions, significant reductions in the mean level of fear of falling were observed. Factors associated with the fear of falling included age, sex, living alone, body mass index and taking psychotropic drugs. The multivariate analysis revealed that females, those aged 72-80, obese individuals and those taking psychotropic drugs were more likely to have a moderate to high fear of falling.","BACKGROUND
Falls are a major public health problem. Fear of falling is highly prevalent amongst community-dwelling older adults who have already fallen and it is also a risk factor for recurrent falls. There has been limited research about the impact that exercises programs have on the fear of falling. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the Otago Exercise Programme (OEP) reduced the fear of falling in non-institutionalised people aged 65-80 years in Spain. It also evaluated the factors associated with the fear of falling.

METHODS
This was a quasi-experimental study that focused on people aged 65-80 who attended 21 primary healthcare centres, lived in the community, were able to walk independently and provided written, informed consent. They were recruited from September 2017 to December 2019. The OEP sessions took place at the primary healthcare centres and were provided on an individual or group basis by trained OEP instructors. The participants attended five weekly sessions, where they were given exercises to develop their strength, balance and endurance. They then continued the programme at home. The subjects were followed up 12 months after baseline and the analyses included a bivariate analysis and a multivariate analysis with logistic regression.

RESULTS
We enroled 498 patients (67.07% female) with an average age of 71.81 years. More than two-thirds (65.06%) lived with a partner and 42.37% were overweight. Significant reductions were observed in the mean level of fear of falling between baseline and 12 months (p = 0.000). A number of factors associated with fear of falling also showed significant differences. These were: age (p = 0.033), sex (p = 0.000), living alone (p = 0.000), body mass index (p = 0.003) and whether psychotropic drugs were used (p = 0.000). The multivariate analysis showed a moderate to high fear of falling amongst participants who were female (p = 0.000), 72-80 years of age (p = 0.017), obese (p = 0.045) and used psychotropic drugs (p = 0.021).

CONCLUSIONS
Taking part in the OEP reduced the overall fear of falling. There were significant associations between fear of falling and being female, taking psychotic drugs and having a history of falls.

27,Intubation rate and adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.,"This study compared the effectiveness, safety, and nurses' satisfaction of a modified high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) system and a commercial HFNC system in treating pediatric respiratory distress patients. 74 children aged 1 month to 5 years were recruited and assigned to two groups. The results showed that intubation rate and adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups, but the commercial group had higher nurses' satisfaction scores than the modified group. The findings suggest that the modified HFNC could be a useful and affordable respiratory support option for younger children with acute respiratory distress.","BACKGROUND
High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a noninvasive respiratory support that provides the optimum flow of an air-oxygen mixture. Several studies demonstrated its usefulness and good safety profile for treating pediatric respiratory distress patients. However, the cost of the commercial HFNC is high; therefore, the modified high-flow nasal cannula was developed.

PURPOSE
This study aimed to compare the effectiveness, safety, and nurses' satisfaction of the modified system versus the standard commercial HFNC.

METHODS
This prospective comparative study was performed in a tertiary care hospital. We recruited children aged 1 month to 5 years who developed acute respiratory distress and were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Patients were assigned to 2 groups (modified vs. commercial). The effectiveness and safety assessments included vital signs, respiratory scores, intubation rate, adverse events, and nurses' satisfaction.

RESULTS
A total of 74 patients were treated with HFNC. Thirty- nine patients were assigned to the modified group, while the remaining 35 patients were in the commercial group. Intubation rate and adverse events did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. However, the commercial group had higher nurses' satisfaction scores than the modified group.

CONCLUSION
Our findings suggest that our low-cost modified HFNC could be a useful respiratory support option for younger children with acute respiratory distress, especially in hospital settings with financial constraints.

Five million deaths per year in under-five children are reported to be due to preventable and treatable causes. IMCI strategy targets these causes through improvement in the case management skills of health care workers. The objectives of this study were to identify eligible clusters and identify & rectify any process, resources, and management-related issues for the main trial.

METHODS
This study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 was conducted for eligibility of Basic Health Units from which sample can be drawn for the main cluster randomized control trial. A single-page proforma was sent to all 54 BHUs of Abbottabad through registered mail service and replies received were analysed through SPSS-V25 and MS Excel-2016. Afterward a sample of 26 BHUs was drawn for the definitive trial. In phase 2, four BHUs were conveniently selected from the remaining sampling frame; one in the control arm while three in the intervention arm. From each BHU, a health care worker responsible for under-five consultations was trained; control arm in standard IMCI while intervention arm on distance learning IMCI. Ten observations in the form of cases managed were assessed at each BHU by a gold standard IMCI master trainer after a specific period. Descriptive summary measures and 95% CI were calculated using SPSS-V25.

RESULTS
Out of 54 BHUs, 3 were nonrespondents while 36 were identified as an eligible sampling frame. The mean index of integrated assessment was found to be 0.90 and 0.89 for the control and intervention arm respectively. Discrepancies in filled forms were noted as 60% in control while 63.3% in intervention arm.

Intensive BP treatment was also associated with an increased risk of hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities in the CAD subgroup, while the risk of serious adverse events did not increase.","To investigate the optimal blood pressure (BP) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), we conducted subgroup analysis using SPRINT data. The study sample included 1206 participants with CAD (of whom 692 underwent coronary revascularization) and 8127 participants without CAD. Participants were randomized into two groups (systolic BP target of 140 mm Hg vs. 120 mm Hg). The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular events. After a median follow-up of 3.9 years, the hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary outcome were 0.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.79) and 1.05 (95% CI 0.76-1.46) among those in the non-CAD and CAD subgroups, respectively (P value for interaction 0.02). Intensive BP treatment was a protective factor for all-cause death (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.96) in the CAD subgroup, compared with standard BP treatment. The HRs (95% CI) for stroke were 3.57 (1.17-10.85) and 1.03 (0.29-3.62) among those in the coronary revascularization and non-revascularization subgroups, respectively (P value for interaction 0.13). For safety events, intensive BP treatment increased the risk of hypotension (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.06-3.79) and electrolyte abnormalities (HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.25-4.56) in the CAD subgroup, while the risk of serious adverse events did not increase (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.20). These results suggest that positive benefits from intensive BP treatment might be attenuated in patients with CAD who are under better secondary prevention.

This study examines whether analgesic responses could be enhanced locally in the exercising limb to further benefit the use of exercise during influenza vaccination processes to minimize vaccine-related pain and improve antibody response to inactivated influenza vaccines. Methods : 57 participants (22.6 ± 3.2 years, 33 females) randomized into a control (n = 19) or one of two exercise groups: pre-vaccine arm (n = 19) or pre-vaccine leg (n = 19). Intervention groups performed exercise (15 minutes), prior to administration of the vaccine. Vaccine-related pain and pressure pain threshold (PPT) were measured at baseline and post-vaccination for all groups. Blood samples were taken on the day of vaccination and one month later to measure serum antibody titers to influenza. Results : No significant difference in vaccine-related pain or change in PPT was found with exercise, however, there was a trend in higher reports of vaccine-related pain in females compared to males( p  = .06). Significantly higher fold increase ( p  = .02) of the B/Brisbane/60/2008 strain was found in the exercise group compared to the control group. Conclusion : The current study failed to observe an analgesic effect of exercise to improve vaccine-related pain in young adults.

The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects was higher in the colchicine group. These results suggest that high-dose colchicine does not reduce infarct size at the acute phase of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction.","BACKGROUND
Inflammation is a key factor of myocardial damage in reperfused ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. We hypothesized that colchicine, a potent anti-inflammatory agent, may reduce infarct size (IS) and left ventricular (LV) remodeling at the acute phase of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction.

METHODS
In this double-blind multicenter trial, we randomly assigned patients admitted for a first episode of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention to receive oral colchicine (2-mg loading dose followed by 0.5 mg twice a day) or matching placebo from admission to day 5. The primary efficacy outcome was IS determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 5 days. The relative LV end-diastolic volume change at 3 months and IS at 3 months assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were among the secondary outcomes.

RESULTS
We enrolled 192 patients, 101 in the colchicine group and 91 in the control group. At 5 days, the gadolinium enhancement-defined IS did not differ between the colchicine and placebo groups with a mean of 26 interquartile range (IQR) [16-44] versus 28.4 IQR [14-40] g of LV mass, respectively ( P =0.87). At 3 months follow-up, there was no significant difference in LV remodeling between the colchicine and placebo groups with a +2.4% (IQR, -8.3% to 11.1%) versus -1.1% (IQR, -8.0% to 9.9%) change in LV end-diastolic volume ( P =0.49). Infarct size at 3 months was also not significantly different between the colchicine and placebo groups (17 IQR [10-28] versus 18 IQR [10-27] g of LV mass, respectively;  P =0.92). The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events during the treatment period was greater with colchicine than with placebo (34% versus 11%, respectively;  P =0.0002).

CONCLUSIONS
In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, oral administration of high-dose colchicine at the time of reperfusion and for 5 days did not reduce IS assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03156816.

We aimed to examine the consequences of early-response to antidementia medication in Alzheimer's disease. Participant-level data were analyzed from five pivotal clinical trials of donepezil for Alzheimer's disease lasting up to 24 weeks (N = 1917). Early-response was based on Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) change scores under minus four from baseline to week six, otherwise classified non-response; then subgrouped by donepezil or placebo. The primary analysis tested the group differences in ADAS-Cog change from baseline for the interval after week six up to 24, based on a three-level mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) model. Four models of increasing complexity were tested, and the most parsimonious model was examined in the primary analysis. The remaining models were tested in sensitivity analysis.

Results showed that those receiving tenecteplase had significantly smaller perfusion lesion volumes on arrival at the hospital. There were no differences in the rate of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage or death at 90 days between the two groups.

Mobile stroke units (MSUs) equipped with a CT scanner reduce time to thrombolytic treatment and improve patient outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that tenecteplase administered in an MSU would result in superior reperfusion at hospital arrival, when compared with alteplase.

METHODS
The TASTE-A trial is a phase 2, randomised, open-label trial at the Melbourne MSU and five tertiary hospitals in Melbourne, VIC, Australia. Patients (aged ≥18 years) with ischaemic stroke who were eligible for thrombolytic treatment were randomly allocated in the MSU to receive, within 4·5 h of symptom onset, either standard-of-care alteplase (0·9 mg/kg [maximum 90 mg], administered intravenously with 10% as a bolus over 1 min and 90% as an infusion over 1 h), or the investigational product tenecteplase (0·25 mg/kg [maximum 25 mg], administered as an intravenous bolus over 10 s), before being transported to hospital for ongoing care. The primary outcome was the volume of the perfusion lesion on arrival at hospital, assessed by CT-perfusion imaging. Secondary safety outcomes were modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 5 or 6 at 90 days, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and any haemorrhage within 36 h, and death at 90 days. Assessors were masked to treatment allocation. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04071613, and is completed.

FINDINGS
Between June 20, 2019, and Nov 16, 2021, 104 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive either tenecteplase (n=55) or alteplase (n=49). The median age of patients was 73 years (IQR 61-83), and the median NIHSS at baseline was 8 (5-14). On arrival at the hospital, the perfusion lesion volume was significantly smaller with tenecteplase (median 12 mL [IQR 3-28]) than with alteplase (35 mL [18-76]; adjusted incidence rate ratio 0·55, 95% CI 0·37-0·81; p=0·0030). At 90 days, an mRS of 5 or 6 was reported in eight (15%) patients allocated to tenecteplase and ten (20%) patients allocated to alteplase (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·70, 95% CI 0·23-2·16; p=0·54). Five (9%) patients allocated to tenecteplase and five (10%) patients allocated to alteplase died from any cause at 90 days (aOR 1·12, 95% CI 0·26-4·90; p=0·88). No cases of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage were reported within 36 h with either treatment. Up to day 90, 13 serious adverse events were noted: five (5%) in patients treated with tenecteplase, and eight (8%) in patients treated with alteplase.

INTERPRETATION
Treatment with tenecteplase on the MSU in Melbourne resulted in a superior rate of early reperfusion compared with alteplase, and no safety concerns were noted. This trial provides evidence to support the use of tenecteplase and MSUs in an optimal model of stroke care.

Results showed that EAT thickness significantly decreased in both semaglutide and dulaglutide groups after 12 weeks, accounting for a 20% reduction. There was no EAT reduction in the metformin group. Body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c improved in all groups. The highest doses of semaglutide (1 mg) and dulaglutide (1.5 mg) resulted in the greatest reduction in EAT thickness. These findings suggest that semaglutide and dulaglutide are effective in reducing EAT thickness.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), the visceral fat depot of the heart, is a modifiable cardio-metbolic risk factor and therapeutic target. Semaglutide and dulaglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, are indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). GLP-1 receptor agonists have recently shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Epicardial adipose tissue expresses GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs). GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide is known to significantly decrease EAT thickness. However, the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists semaglutide and dulaglutide on EAT thickness are unknown.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We performed a 12-week, controlled, parallel study in 80 subjects with T2DM and obesity. Patients received either semaglutide, up to 1 mg subcutaneous (sc) weekly, or dulaglutide, up to 1.5 mg sc weekly, as the standard of care in addition to their usual medication regimen. Twenty subjects with T2DM and obesity were started on metformin and a diet and served as the control group. Ultrasound-measured EAT thickness was measured at baseline and at the 12-week follow-up.

RESULTS
Epicardial adipose tissue thickness significantly decreased in both semaglutide and dulaglutide groups ( P  < 0.001) after 12 weeks, accounting for a 20% reduction. There was no EAT reduction in the metformin group. Body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c improved in all groups without reaching statistical significance. Epicardial adipose tissue thickness reduction was significantly greater ( P  < 0.01) with the higher doses of semaglutide (1 mg) and dulaglutide (1.5 mg), respectively.

CONCLUSION
Weekly administration of either GLP-1 receptor agonists semaglutide or dulaglutide causes a rapid, substantial, and dose-dependent reduction in EAT thickness.
","In this study, scientists looked at whether taking two types of medication called semaglutide and dulaglutide, which are used to treat type 2 diabetes, could reduce the thickness of a type of fat near the heart called epicardial adipose tissue (EAT).

They found that the people who took either semaglutide or dulaglutide had a 20% reduction in the thickness of their EAT, which was a lot more than the people who took metformin or no medication. Taking higher doses of the medications also had a greater effect in reducing the thickness of EAT.",Agree,"The population is mentioned, and described accurately",The intervention is underspecified,"The outcome is mentioned, and described accurately",Major omission(s),No errors,Agree,Disagree,Strongly agree,"The population is mentioned, and described accurately","The intervention is mentioned, and described accurately","The outcome is mentioned, and described accurately",No omission,Minor error,Agree,Strongly agree,All,Agree,121,"{""choices"": [""Omits dosage or other important detail about administration"", ""Other""]}",,,"1.

The recent multicenter, randomized, open-label INDEPENDENT study demonstrated that sevelamer improves survival in new to hemodialysis (HD) patients compared with calcium carbonate. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of sevelamer versus calcium carbonate for patients new to HD, using patient-level data from the INDEPENDENT study.

STUDY DESIGN
Cost-effectiveness analysis.

SETTING AND POPULATION
Adult patients new to HD in Italy.

MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, TIMEFRAME
A patient-level cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, Italy's national health service. The analysis was conducted for a 3-year time horizon. The cost of dialysis was excluded from the base case analysis.

INTERVENTION
Sevelamer was compared to calcium carbonate.

OUTCOMES
Total life years (LYs), total costs, and the incremental cost per LY gained were calculated. Bootstrapping was used to estimate confidence intervals around LYs, costs, and cost-effectiveness and to calculate the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.

RESULTS
Sevelamer was associated with a gain of 0.26 in LYs compared to calcium carbonate, over the 3-year time horizon. Total drug costs were €3,282 higher for sevelamer versus calcium carbonate, while total hospitalization costs were €2,020 lower for sevelamer versus calcium carbonate. The total incremental cost of sevelamer versus calcium carbonate was €1,262, resulting in a cost per LY gained of €4,897. The bootstrap analysis demonstrated that sevelamer was cost effective compared with calcium carbonate in 99.4 % of 10,000 bootstrap replicates, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per LY gained.

LIMITATIONS
Data on hospitalizations was taken from a post hoc retrospective chart review of the patients included in the INDEPENDENT study. Patient quality of life or health utility was not included in the analysis.

37,Smaller increases in TMT and MTP joint forces were noted following the Ludloff when compared to the intact state (95.6 vs 93.3 N at TMT and 109.2 vs 103.2 N at MTP).,"This study examined the effects of two types of proximal first metatarsal osteotomies, Ludloff and Proximal Opening Wedge Osteotomy (POWO), on articular contact properties. The findings suggest that POWO may lead to greater alterations in articular contact properties than Ludloff, with increases in peak pressure at the MTP and TMT joints and a slight change in pressure distribution. However, the changes were not statistically significant and the effects of larger osteotomies on long-term joint health need to be further studied.","Background
An understudied area of proximal first metatarsal osteotomies is the effect on articular contact properties following the surgeries. Potential long-term risks include altered joint mechanics and possible arthritic progression. A biomechanical comparison of articular characteristics of the proximal opening wedge and Ludloff osteotomies was performed in this study. It was hypothesized that the proximal opening wedge osteotomy (POWO) would lead to greater alterations in articular contact properties along the first ray.
Methods
Seven paired fresh-frozen below-knee cadaveric limbs with hallux valgus were selected. Specimens in each pair were tested in the intact state and then randomized to receive either a Ludloff or POWO. A 4-mm opening wedge osteotomy was used in all cases. Loading of the flexor hallucis longus was to 100 N using an instrumented tensioner. A 28-N load was added at the distal phalanx to simulate the ground reaction force. First metatarsophalangeal (MTP) and tarsometatarsal (TMT) articular properties were recorded simultaneously using 2 pressure sensors. For each state, a pressure map was generated and contact area, peak pressure, and center of pressure were calculated. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess statistical significance.
Results
Average peak pressure was noted to be elevated at the MTP (4.6 vs 6.9 mPa,  P  = .04) and TMT (3.3 mPa vs 5.1 mPa,  P  = .30) joints when comparing the Ludloff and the POWO, respectively. Contact area was also noted to be lower in the POWO relative to the Ludloff for the MTP (86.6 vs 69.1 mm 2 ,  P  = .30) but not the TMT joints (89.1 vs 88.5 mm 2 ,  P  = .97). There was a slight plantar-lateral and dorsomedial shift in pressure at the MTP and TMT articulations, respectively, of the POWO relative to the Ludloff. A trend toward decreased contact force within the TMT joint was noted following opening wedge osteotomy relative to the intact state (103.8 vs 113.9 N,  P  = .31), while forces were elevated at the MTP joint (104.3 vs 96.0 N,  P  = .63), although not statistically significant. Smaller increases in TMT and MTP joint forces were noted following the Ludloff when compared to the intact state (95.6 vs 93.3 N at TMT and 109.2 vs 103.2 N at MTP).
Conclusion
POWO can potentially change articular contact characteristics along the TMT and MTP articulations of the first ray. This could possibly lead to altered loading patterns and possible long-term damage vs other osteotomies.
Clinical Relevance
While it is unlikely that the changes observed with the sizes of the osteotomy commonly used would lead to long-term significant clinical consequences, further study with larger group sizes would be beneficial.","This passage is about studies that look at how different types of surgeries on the bones in the foot affect how the joints in the foot move.

Compared with the group with normal renal function, the mean romosozumab exposure was 31% and 43% higher as measured by maximum observed serum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve, respectively, in the severe RI group and similar to those in the ESRD-RH group. For all 3 groups, the maximum mean percent increase in procollagen type 1 N terminal propeptide and decrease in serum C-telopeptide levels from baseline were observed on day 15.

Unannounced standardised patients were sent to all five primary care teams in an urban safety-net healthcare system to assess whether the physician fully elicited and responded to housing and social isolation needs. The intervention consisted of providing physicians with audit/feedback reports of their SDOH practices, along with brief written educational material. Results showed that providing feedback on SDOH practices was associated with increased rates of eliciting and responding to housing and social isolation needs.","BACKGROUND
Although efforts are underway to address social determinants of health (SDOH), little is known about physicians' SDOH practices despite evidence that failing to fully elicit and respond to social needs can compromise patient safety and undermine both the quality and effectiveness of treatment. In particular, interventions designed to enhance response to social needs have not been assessed using actual practice behaviour. In this study, we evaluate the degree to which providing primary care physicians with feedback on their SDOH practice behaviours is associated with increased rates of eliciting and responding to housing and social isolation needs.

METHODS
Unannounced standardised patients (USPs), actors trained to consistently portray clinical scenarios, were sent, incognito, to all five primary care teams in an urban, safety-net healthcare system. Scenarios involved common primary care conditions and each included an underlying housing (eg, mould in the apartment, crowding) and social isolation issue and USPs assessed whether the physician fully elicited these needs and if so, whether or not they addressed them. The intervention consisted of providing physicians with audit/feedback reports of their SDOH practices, along with brief written educational material. A prepost comparison group design was used to evaluate the intervention; four teams received the intervention and one team served as a 'proxy' comparison (no intervention). Preintervention (February 2017 to December 2017) rates of screening for and response to the scripted housing and social needs were compared with intervention period (January 2018 to March 2019) rates for both intervention and comparison teams.

RESULTS
108 visits were completed preintervention and 183 during the intervention period. Overall, social needs were not elicited half of the time and fully addressed even less frequently. Rates of identifying the housing issue increased for teams that received audit/feedback reports (46%-60%; p=0.045) and declined for the proxy comparison (61%-42%; p=0.174). Rates of responding to housing needs increased significantly for intervention teams (15%-41%; p=0.004) but not for the comparison team (21%-29%; p=0.663). Social isolation was identified more frequently postintervention (53%) compared with baseline (39%; p=0.041) among the intervention teams but remained unchanged for the comparison team (39% vs 32%; p=0.601). Full exploration of social isolation remained low for both intervention and comparison teams.

CONCLUSIONS
Results suggest that physicians may not be consistently screening for or responding to social needs but that receiving feedback on those practices, along with brief targeted education, can improve rates of SDOH screening and response.

The Parental Friendship Coaching (PFC) intervention teaches parents to coach their children with ADHD in friendship skills, which includes managing emotions. We examined whether PFC, relative to psychoeducation and social support (Coping with ADHD through Relationships and Education; CARE), improved parental emotion-related socialization behaviors, child affect with a friend, and child social behaviors related to emotional difficulties. Participants were 172 families of children with ADHD (ages 6-11, 30% female), randomized to PFC or CARE. At baseline, children and their real-life friends interacted and their affect was coded. Parents coached their child in friendship skills before and after the child-friend interaction, and parents' praise, warmth, criticism, and discussion of emotion-related friendship strategies were coded. Parents and teachers reported children's withdrawn/depressed and aggressive behaviors.

To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of eptinezumab 100 and 300 mg compared with placebo in patients with the dual diagnosis of chronic migraine (CM) and medication-overuse headache (MOH).

BACKGROUND
Eptinezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide, may be effective for treating patients with a dual diagnosis of CM and MOH.

METHODS
PROMISE-2 (NCT02974153) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study that comprised a screening visit, a 28-day pretreatment period, and a 32-week study duration. Patients in this exploratory analysis of a prespecified subgroup had confirmed diagnoses of both CM and MOH at screening. Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous eptinezumab 100, 300 mg, or placebo every 12 weeks. Efficacy outcomes included mean changes from baseline in monthly migraine days (MMDs) during weeks 1-12, migraine responder rates at week 12, and percentages of patients below International Classification of Headache Disorders thresholds for CM and MOH over weeks 1-24.

RESULTS
There were 431 patients who were diagnosed with CM and MOH as specified in the protocol and received eptinezumab 100 mg (n = 139), 300 mg (n = 147), or placebo (n = 145). During the baseline period, these patients experienced an average of 16.7 migraine days across treatment arms. Over weeks 1-12, eptinezumab-treated patients experienced greater reductions from baseline in MMDs than placebo patients (100 mg, change from baseline = -8.4, difference from placebo [95% confidence interval (CI)] = -3.0 [-4.56, -1.52], p < 0.0001 vs. placebo; 300 mg, change from baseline = -8.6, difference from placebo [95% CI] = -3.2 [-4.66, -1.78], p < 0.0001 vs. placebo; placebo, -5.4). Compared with placebo, more eptinezumab-treated patients were ≥50% migraine responders (100 mg, 84/139 [60.4%]; 300 mg, 91/147 [61.9%]; placebo, 50/145 [34.5%]) or ≥75% responders (100 mg, 38/139 [27.3%]; 300 mg, 44/147 [29.9%]; placebo, 21/145 [14.5%]) over weeks 1-12. Therapeutic benefits with eptinezumab were observed from day 1 after dosing, and improvements were sustained with an additional dose. For the full 24-week treatment period, 71/139 (51.1%), 80/147 (54.4%), and 47/145 (32.4%) of 100, 300 mg, and placebo-treated patients, respectively, were below CM thresholds, and of the patients who provided sufficient acute medication data, 47/93 (50.5%), 53/107 (49.5%), and 26/96 (27.1%), respectively, were below medication-overuse thresholds.

CONCLUSIONS
In patients diagnosed with both CM and MOH, eptinezumab treatment resulted in greater reductions in MMDs, higher responder rates, and fewer patients meeting CM and MOH criteria, thus demonstrating the efficacy and clinical utility of eptinezumab in this patient population.

These results suggest that social media should be prioritized in outreach efforts for this condition.","IMPORTANCE
Outreach based on user characteristics through social media advertising is significantly more effective than outreach based on user interests with search engine advertising for female stress urinary incontinence.

OBJECTIVE
The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of 2 online outreach platforms to engage women at risk of stress urinary incontinence with a high-quality patient education website.

STUDY DESIGN
A geographic randomized trial was performed comparing online advertising on Facebook, a social media site, versus Google Ads, a search engine, to direct viewers to VoicesForPFD.org. Advertisements were developed using health communication theory and pretested before the randomized trial. Counties in the Pacific Northwest were grouped into approximately equal populations, called ""supercounties,"" and randomized to advertisement platforms. Educational website views resulting from each campaign, called sessions, were measured using Google Analytics; the primary outcome was the number of sessions per supercounty. County characteristics were obtained from national survey data. Effectiveness of the advertising platforms was compared between randomization arms using Welch's unequal variances t test, and crude and adjusted linear regression models.

RESULTS
Mean user sessions were significantly higher in areas randomized to Facebook advertising (470 sessions) compared with areas randomized to Google Ads advertising [44 sessions; mean, 426 session difference (95% confidence interval, 199-653 sessions); P = 0.001]. After accounting for adult female population and rurality, randomization to Facebook instead of Google Ads still resulted in 409 additional sessions (95% confidence interval, 317-501 sessions; P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS
Social media was 10 times more effective (470 versus 44 mean sessions per supercounty) than search engine outreach advertising and should be prioritized in outreach efforts. Future work is needed on engagement and behavior change with online outreach.

The Newborn Weight Tool (NEWT) can inform newborn feeding decisions and might reduce health care utilization by preventing excess weight loss. Clinical decision support (CDS) displaying NEWT might facilitate its use. Our study's objective is to determine the effect of CDS displaying NEWT on feeding and health care utilization.

METHODS
At an hospital involved in NEWT development, we randomly assigned 2682 healthy infants born ≥36 weeks gestation in 2018-2019 either to CDS displaying NEWT with an electronic flag if most recent weight was ≥75th weight loss centile or to a control of usual care with NEWT accessed at clinician discretion. Our primary outcome was feeding type concordant with weight loss, defined as exclusive breastfeeding for those not flagged, exclusive breastfeeding or supplementation for those flagged once, and supplementation for those flagged more than once. Secondary outcomes included inpatient and outpatient utilization in the first 30 days. We used χ2 and Student's t tests to compare intervention infants with control and to compare trial infants with those born in 2017.

RESULTS
Feeding was concordant with for 1854 (74.5%) trial infants and did not differ between randomized groups (P = .65); concordant feeding was higher for all trial infants than for infants born in 2017 (64.4%; P < .0005). Readmission occurred for 51 (3.8%) CDS infants and 45 (3.4%) control infants (P = .56). Among the 60% of trial infants with outpatient records available, there were 3.5 ± 1.7 visits with no differences between randomized groups (P = .10).

VBR was found to be safe and well-tolerated, and enhanced viral suppression was demonstrated by greater reductions in HBV DNA and pregenomic RNA compared to NrtIs alone.","BACKGROUND & AIMS
HBV nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NrtIs) do not completely suppress HBV replication. Previous reports indicate persistent viremia during NrtI treatment despite HBV DNA being undetectable. HBV core inhibitors may enhance viral suppression when combined with NrtIs. This phase II trial (NCT03576066) evaluated the efficacy and safety of the investigational core inhibitor, vebicorvir (VBR), in virologically- suppressed patients on NrtIs.

METHODS
Non-cirrhotic, NrtI-suppressed patients with chronic HBV were randomised to VBR 300 mg once daily or matching placebo (PBO) for 24 weeks. Treatment was stratified by hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status. The primary endpoint was change from Baseline in serum HBeAg or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) after 24 weeks.

RESULTS
Of 73 patients enrolled, 47 were HBeAg positive and 26 were HBeAg negative. In HBeAg-positive and -negative patients, there were no differences in the change from Baseline at Week 24 for HBsAg or HBeAg. Using a novel, high-sensitivity assay to detect HBV DNA, a greater proportion of patients with detectable HBV DNA at Baseline achieved undetectable HBV DNA at Week 24 in the VBR+NrtI vs. PBO+NrtI group. In HBeAg-positive patients, a greater change from Baseline in HBV pregenomic (pg)RNA was observed at Week 24 with VBR+NrtI vs. PBO+NrtI. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in VBR+NrtI patients included upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, and pruritus. No serious adverse events, Grade 4 TEAEs, or deaths were reported.

CONCLUSIONS
In this 24-week study, VBR+NrtI demonstrated a favourable safety and tolerability profile. While there were no significant changes in viral antigen levels, enhanced viral suppression was demonstrated by greater changes in DNA and pgRNA with the addition of VBR compared to NrtI alone.

PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY
Antalya Training and Research Hospital, from April 2018 to December 2018.

METHODOLOGY
Patients in whom laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)were done starting at a level of 2 cm or closer to pylorus were included in the study. Patients were divided into one of the two groups based on the distance between the pylorus and the resection margin: group 1 having resection ≤10 mm and group 2 at 11-20 mm. Above mentioned parameters were compared in both groups.

RESULTS
Ninety-two patients were included. Postoperative nausea and vomiting rates were similar in both groups. At the end of the first year, % EWL was 82.9% and 73.5% in groups 1 and 2 (p=0.003).

CONCLUSION
Starting antrectomy at a distance of 2 cm or less from the pylorus is safe and effective. Starting antrectomy at a distance of 1 cm or less from the pylorus in LSG provides effective weight loss without increasing complications.

This suggests that the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs)/sEH pathway may play a role in modulating adipose and systemic inflammation in obesity.","Adipose tissue contains a complex immune environment and is a central contributor to heightened systemic inflammation in obese persons. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are lipid signaling molecules that decrease inflammation in obese animals, but their effect on inflammation in humans is unknown. The enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) hydrolyzes EETs to less active diols, and we hypothesized that pharmacologic sEH inhibition would decrease adipose inflammation in obese individuals. We treated obese prediabetic adults with the sEH inhibitor GSK2256294 versus placebo in a crossover design, collected subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue via lipoaspiration and characterized the tissue T cell profile. Treatment with GSK2256294 decreased the percentage of pro-inflammatory T cells producing interferon-gamma (IFNγ), but not interleukin (IL)-17A, and decreased the amount of secreted tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα).

It is commonly believed that blinding to treatment assignment is necessary for placebos to have an effect. However, placebos administered without concealment (ie, open-label placebos [OLPs]) have recently been shown to be effective in some conditions. This study had 2 objectives: first, to determine whether OLP treatment is superior to no-pill control (NPC) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and, second, to compare the efficacy of OLP against double-blind placebo (DBP). In a 6-week, 3-arm, randomized clinical trial, participants were randomized in equal proportions to 3 arms: OLP, DBP, or NPC. Two hundred sixty-two adults (72.9% women), with a mean age of 42.0 (SD = 18.1) years, participated in the primary study. The mean improvement on the IBS Severity Scoring System from baseline to the 6-week end point was significantly greater in OLP compared with that in NPC (90.6 vs 52.3, P = 0.038). Open-label placebo and DBP did not differ significantly on IBS Severity Scoring System improvement (100.3 vs 90.6, P = 0.485). Standardized effect sizes were moderate for OLP vs NPC (d = 0.43) and small for OLP vs DBP (d = 0.10). Participants treated with OLP reported clinically meaningful improvements in IBS symptoms that were significantly greater than those on NPC. Open-label placebo and DBP had similar effects that did not differ significantly, suggesting that blinding may not be necessary for placebos to be effective and that OLP could play a role in the management of patients with refractory IBS.

These findings suggest that integrated exercise interventions can effectively improve physical functions, cognitive function, and quality of life in elderly nursing home residents.","OBJECTIVES
The frail elderly have an increased risk of frailty because of reduced physical activity, cognitive ability and quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the effects of integrated exercise intervention on the attenuation of frailty in elderly nursing home residents.

DESIGN
This study was a cluster randomized controlled trial.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS
146 elderly frailty people from 8 elderly nursing homes in Harbin, China, were randomly assigned into the intervention group and control group after obtaining their informed consent.

INTERVENTION
The intervention group performed integrated exercise interventions for 12 months, while the control group only continued with their daily activities.

MEASUREMENTS
Sociodemographic, health-related data, frailty levels, gait parameters, cognition, and quality of life were evaluated.

RESULTS
The mean age of participants was 80.74± 2.89 years, and 70.37% (n=95) were female. The Difference-in-difference regression showed that, compared with the control group, phenotypic frailty score (β3 =-1.40, p < 0.001) and stride time (β3 = -0.38, p <0.001) decreased significantly in the intervention group, stride velocity (β3 = 0.24, p < 0.001), step length (β3 = 0.08, p <0.001), cadence (β3 = 17.79, p < 0.001), MMSE total score (β3 = 1.90, p < 0.001) and QOL total score (β3 = 11.84, p < 0.001) increased significantly in the intervention group.

CONCLUSION
The integrated exercise intervention can effectively improve the attenuation of frailty, gait parameters, cognitive function, and quality of life in elderly nursing homes. We can use the findings of this study as a reference for the design of activities for the elderly nursing home residents, to provide them with appropriate exercises, improve their physical functions, and improve or delay their frailty level, which is principally important for developing countries in east Asia where rehabilitation resources are generally scarce.

50,Both PPD Tuberculin and Mw vaccine are effective in the treatment of recalcitrant warts with minimal recurrence rate.,"This study evaluated the treatment outcome of intralesional PPD tuberculin and Mw vaccine in the treatment of recalcitrant extragenital warts in immunocompetent subjects. Results showed that both PPD Tuberculin and Mw vaccine were effective in treating recalcitrant warts, with 52.17% and 62.75% of patients in groups A and B, respectively, having complete clearance in all warts. Additionally, there was a significant improvement in the mean DLQI scores after treatment in both groups. It is recommended that both PPD Tuberculin and Mw vaccine be used as first-line therapies in the treatment of difficult to treat warts.","Introduction
Of late, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of recalcitrant and difficult to treat warts. Purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PDD) and mycobacterium w (Mw) vaccine hold promising prospects for the treatment of verruca, especially in a country like ours where a majority of the population is already sensitized to mycobacterium tuberculosis both due to disease endemicity and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination.
Aims and Objectives
We aimed at evaluating the treatment outcome of intralesional PPD tuberculin and Mw vaccine in the treatment of recalcitrant extragenital warts in immunocompetent subjects.
Materials and Methods
The patients included immunocompetent subjects between the ages of 16 and 65 years with two or more extragenital warts. The patients were randomized into two groups, namely A (PPD Tuberculin) and B (Mw vaccine). In both groups, 0.1 mL of active intralesional immunogen was injected at the base of the largest wart. The doses were repeated at 4 weeks' intervals for a maximum of 5 injections. Additionally, the improvement in quality of life was measured using the Hindi-validated version of the Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) questionnaire.
Results
Ninety-seven patients completed the study, with 46 in group A and 51 in group B. In group A, 24 (52.17%) patients had complete clearance in all warts, and in group B, 32 (62.75%) ( P  = 0.38). The most common adverse event in patients of group A was transient injection site erythema and swelling, whereas that in group B was mild transient fever. None of the patients showed any signs of recurrence in the ensuing follow-up period. There was a statistically significant improvement in the mean DLQI scores after treatment in both groups ( P  < 0.0001).
Conclusion
Both PPD Tuberculin and Mw vaccine are effective in the treatment of recalcitrant warts with minimal recurrence rate. The safety profile of PPD is superior to Mw vaccine. We suggest both to be used as first-line therapy in the treatment of difficult to treat warts.","This passage is talking about two different treatments for warts that are hard to get rid of. The treatments, called PPD Tuberculin and Mw vaccine, were tested on 97 people. The results showed that both treatments were effective at getting rid of the warts with few side effects, and the people felt better after the treatment.

51,Differences in adherence to neonatal health protocols within and between the study arms were assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum and permutation tests for each morbidity type.,"This study assessed the adherence to neonatal health protocols before and during the implementation of a mHealth clinical decision-making support system in a low-resource setting. The study found nonsignificant improvement in protocol adherence in the intervention clusters and significant improvement in the control clusters, suggesting that mHealth interventions may not be able to improve protocol adherence. It was also found that concurrent neonatal health improvement activities were likely to improve protocol adherence.","BACKGROUND
This study assessed health workers' adherence to neonatal health protocols before and during the implementation of a mobile health (mHealth) clinical decision-making support system (mCDMSS) that sought to bridge access to neonatal health protocol gap in a low-resource setting.

METHODS
We performed a cross-sectional document review within two purposively selected clusters (one poorly-resourced and one well-resourced), from each arm of a cluster-randomized trial at two different time points: before and during the trial. The total trial consisted of 16 clusters randomized into 8 intervention and 8 control clusters to assess the impact of an mCDMSS on neonatal mortality in Ghana. We evaluated health workers' adherence (expressed as percentages) to birth asphyxia, neonatal jaundice and cord sepsis protocols by reviewing medical records of neonatal in-patients using a checklist. Differences in adherence to neonatal health protocols within and between the study arms were assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum and permutation tests for each morbidity type. In addition, we tracked concurrent neonatal health improvement activities in the clusters during the 18-month intervention period.

RESULTS
In the intervention arm, mean adherence was 35.2% (SD = 5.8%) and 43.6% (SD = 27.5%) for asphyxia; 25.0% (SD = 14.8%) and 39.3% (SD = 27.7%) for jaundice; 52.0% (SD = 11.0%) and 75.0% (SD = 21.2%) for cord sepsis protocols in the pre-intervention and intervention periods respectively. In the control arm, mean adherence was 52.9% (SD = 16.4%) and 74.5% (SD = 14.7%) for asphyxia; 45.1% (SD = 12.8%) and 64.6% (SD = 8.2%) for jaundice; 53.8% (SD = 16.0%) and 60.8% (SD = 11.7%) for cord sepsis protocols in the pre-intervention and intervention periods respectively. We observed nonsignificant improvement in protocol adherence in the intervention clusters but significant improvement in protocol adherence in the control clusters. There were 2 concurrent neonatal health improvement activities in the intervention clusters and over 12 in the control clusters during the intervention period.

CONCLUSION
Whether mHealth interventions can improve adherence to neonatal health protocols in low-resource settings cannot be ascertained by this study. Neonatal health improvement activities are however likely to improve protocol adherence. Future mHealth evaluations of protocol adherence must account for other concurrent interventions in study contexts.

Results showed that the use of the system reduced the adenoma miss rate and sessile serrated lesion miss rate, and increased the adenomas per colonoscopy rate compared to high-definition white light colonoscopy alone.","BACKGROUND & AIMS
Artificial intelligence-based computer-aided polyp detection (CADe) systems are intended to address the issue of missed polyps during colonoscopy. The effect of CADe during screening and surveillance colonoscopy has not previously been studied in a United States (U.S.) population.

METHODS
We conducted a prospective, multi-center, single-blind randomized tandem colonoscopy study to evaluate a deep-learning based CADe system (EndoScreener, Shanghai Wision AI, China). Patients were enrolled across 4 U.S. academic medical centers from 2019 through 2020. Patients presenting for colorectal cancer screening or surveillance were randomized to CADe colonoscopy first or high-definition white light (HDWL) colonoscopy first, followed immediately by the other procedure in tandem fashion by the same endoscopist. The primary outcome was adenoma miss rate (AMR), and secondary outcomes included sessile serrated lesion (SSL) miss rate and adenomas per colonoscopy (APC).

RESULTS
A total of 232 patients entered the study, with 116 patients randomized to undergo CADe colonoscopy first and 116 patients randomized to undergo HDWL colonoscopy first. After the exclusion of 9 patients, the study cohort included 223 patients. AMR was lower in the CADe-first group compared with the HDWL-first group (20.12% [34/169] vs 31.25% [45/144]; odds ratio [OR], 1.8048; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0780-3.0217; P = .0247). SSL miss rate was lower in the CADe-first group (7.14% [1/14]) vs the HDWL-first group (42.11% [8/19]; P = .0482). First-pass APC was higher in the CADe-first group (1.19 [standard deviation (SD), 2.03] vs 0.90 [SD, 1.55]; P = .0323). First-pass ADR was 50.44% in the CADe-first group and 43.64 % in the HDWL-first group (P = .3091).

CONCLUSION
In this U.S. multicenter tandem colonoscopy randomized controlled trial, we demonstrate a decrease in AMR and SSL miss rate and an increase in first-pass APC with the use of a CADe-system when compared with HDWL colonoscopy alone.

53,A single oral dose of citalopram 'shifted' the response in the ASD group towards the neurotypical baseline but did not alter response in the control group.,"In this study, researchers used REACT to investigate differences in the serotonin transporter (SERT) response to aversive facial emotion in adults with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). They found that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed a baseline group difference in the SERT-enriched response to faces in the ASD group, and that a single oral dose of citalopram shifted the response in the ASD group towards the neurotypical baseline but did not alter response in the control group. The findings suggest that the SERT-enriched functional network is dynamically different in ASD during processing of socially relevant stimuli.","BACKGROUND
Alterations in the serotonergic control of brain pathways responsible for facial emotion processing in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be a target for intervention. However, the molecular underpinnings of autistic-neurotypical serotonergic differences are challenging to access in vivo. Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT) has helped define molecular-enriched functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain networks based on a priori information about the spatial distribution of neurochemical systems from available PET templates.

METHODS
We used REACT to estimate the dominant fMRI signal related to the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) distribution during processing of aversive facial emotion in adults with and without ASD. We first predicted a group difference in baseline (placebo) functioning of this system. We next used a single 20 mg oral dose of citalopram, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, to test the hypothesis that network activity in people with and without ASD would respond differently to inhibition of SERT. To confirm the specificity of our findings, we also repeated the analysis with 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and 5-HT4 receptor maps.

RESULTS
Using REACT with the SERT map, we found a baseline group difference in the SERT-enriched response to faces in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. A single oral dose of citalopram 'shifted' the response in the ASD group towards the neurotypical baseline but did not alter response in the control group. Similar differences in SERT-enriched response were observed after controlling for other 5-HT maps.

CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that the SERT-enriched functional network is dynamically different in ASD during processing of socially relevant stimuli. Whether this acute neurobiological response to citalopram in ASD translates to a clinical target will be an important next step.

Secondary outcomes were tummy time duration (accelerometry), adherence to physical activity guidelines, head shape, and motor development. Measures were taken at baseline, post-intervention, and when infants were 6 months of age. Analyses were by linear mixed models and Cohen's  d  statistic.

RESULTS
Recruitment, retention, and collection of objective data met feasibility targets. Acceptability was also met with intervention mothers reporting the information, goal planning, and handouts significantly more useful and relevant than control group mothers ( p  < 0.01). Moderate effect sizes were also found at post-intervention for tummy time duration, adherence to physical activity guidelines and infant ability in prone and supine favoring the intervention group (intervention infants had a mean of 30 min and 30% adherence to guidelines (95% CI 0 to 60.6 min) compared to the control infants who had a mean of 16.6 min and 13% adherence to the guidelines (95% CI 0 to 42.1 min, Cohen's  d  = 0.5). Limitations were the small sample size, 4-week intervention, limited accelerometer use, and a homogenous sample of participants.

CONCLUSION
Group tummy time classes delivered in a mother's group setting were shown to be feasible and acceptable. A larger randomized controlled trial is warranted.

E-cigarette studies have found that the use of a variety of flavors and customizable devices results in greater use frequency and user satisfaction. However, standardized research e-cigarettes are being developed as closed systems with limited flavor options, potentially limiting user satisfaction. In this study, we explore protocol compliance in an e-cigarette study using a standardized, assigned device with puff time and duration tracking (controlled e-cigarette) and potential limitations that controlled devices and e-liquids can introduce.

METHODS
In a crossover study, 49 young adult e-cigarette users were recruited using convenience sampling and assigned a controlled e-cigarette device and flavored or unflavored e-liquids on standardized protocols. E-cigarette use frequency (number of puffs per day, collected from the device) and serum cotinine levels were obtained at each of three study visits over 3 weeks. The correlation of cotinine and e-cigarette use over the preceding week was calculated at each study visit.

RESULTS
Correlation of nicotine intake, as measured by serum cotinine, and puff time, as measured by puffs count and duration from the e-cigarette device, as an indicator of study protocol compliance, substantially declined after the first week of the study and were no longer correlated in the remaining study weeks (R2 = 0.53 and p ≤ .01 in week 1, R2 < 0.5 and p > .05 for remaining weeks).

CONCLUSIONS
There is an emerging need for controlled e-cigarette exposures studies, but low compliance in the use of assigned devices and e-liquids may be a limitation that needs to be mitigated in future studies.

IMPLICATIONS
This study is the first to analyze compliance with instructions to use a standardized e-cigarette device with puff time and duration tracking (controlled e-cigarette) across all subjects and an assigned e-liquid flavor over a 3-week period. We find that protocol compliance, as measured by correlations between e-cigarette use measures and cotinine levels, was only achieved in the first week of the study and declined thereafter. These findings indicate that the assignment of a study device and instruction to only use the study device with assigned e-liquid flavor may not be sufficient to ensure participant compliance with the study protocol. We suggest that additional measures, including behavioral and biological markers, are needed to ensure sole use of the study e-cigarette and e-liquid and to be able to interpret results from controlled e-cigarette studies.
","This study looked at how people use e-cigarettes. It found that people were more likely to follow instructions when they were given a device with limited flavors to use. However, after the first week of the study, the people were less likely to follow the instructions and use the device with the assigned e-liquid flavor. This means that people may not follow instructions when given a device with limited flavors and this should be taken into account when doing future studies.",Strongly agree,The population is underspecified,"The intervention is mentioned, and described accurately","The outcome is mentioned, and described accurately",Minor omission(s),No errors,Strongly agree,Agree,Strongly agree,"The population is mentioned, and described accurately","The intervention is mentioned, and described accurately","The outcome is mentioned, and described accurately",No omission,No errors,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,All,Strongly agree,121,,Omits sample size,,,,,,,,
60,No significant difference in the general ophthalmia neonatorum rate was found for any of the four factors (P > .14 by Fisher exact test).,"This study investigated the effect of prophylaxis with povidone-iodine, silver nitrate, and erythromycin on the occurrence of ophthalmia neonatorum in 3117 neonates. It was found that while there was no significant difference in the general ophthalmia neonatorum rate, those born to mothers with vaginitis had a five-fold higher relative risk of venereal ophthalmia neonatorum and a twenty-five-fold higher relative risk of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum. The researchers concluded that neonates born to mothers with vaginitis should be closely monitored for the development of ophthalmia neonatorum, even when a prophylactic agent is used.","BACKGROUND
Ophthalmia neonatorum still blinds approximately 10,000 babies annually worldwide. Identification of contributory maternal perinatal factors could possibly predict which babies are at greater risk for this disease.

METHODS
In a randomized prospective study of ophthalmia neonatorum in Kenya, we studied the effect of prophylaxis with povidone-iodine, silver nitrate, and erythromycin in 3117 neonates. Four perinatal factors that may promote ophthalmia neonatorum were investigated: maternal vaginitis, birth in a nonsterile environment, presence of meconium at birth, and postnatal development of endometritis.

RESULTS
No significant difference in the general ophthalmia neonatorum rate was found for any of the four factors (P > .14 by Fisher exact test). However, with regard to venereal ophthalmia neonatorum, the 26 infants born to mothers with vaginitis had a relative risk 5.1 times that of the rest of the infants (P = 0.0013). Their relative risk to develop gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum in particular was 24.9 times the rest of the neonates (P = 0.0000031). Prophylaxis was with povidone-iodine in 12 infants, silver nitrate in two, and erythromycin in 12. The frequency of ophthalmia neonatorum was 25%, 100%, and 33%, respectively (differences not significant).

CONCLUSION
Neonates born to mothers with vaginitis should be carefully observed for the first postnatal month for the development of ophthalmia neonatorum, even though a prophylactic agent has been used.

Scalable deprescribing interventions may reduce polypharmacy and the use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs); however, few studies have been large enough to evaluate the impact that deprescribing may have on adverse drug events (ADEs).
Objective
To evaluate the effect of an electronic deprescribing decision support tool on ADEs after hospital discharge among older adults with polypharmacy.
Design, Setting, and Participants
This was a cluster randomized clinical trial of older (≥65 years) hospitalized patients with an expected survival of more than 3 months who were admitted to 1 of 11 acute care hospitals in Canada from August 22, 2017, to January 13, 2020. At admission, participants were taking 5 or more medications per day. Data analyses were performed from January 3, 2021, to September 23, 2021.
Interventions
Personalized reports of deprescribing opportunities generated by MedSafer software to address usual home medications and measures of prognosis and frailty. Deprescribing reports provided to the treating team were compared with usual care (medication reconciliation).
Main Outcomes and Measures
The primary outcome was a reduction of ADEs within the first 30 days postdischarge (including adverse drug withdrawal events) captured through structured telephone surveys and adjudicated blinded to intervention status. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients with 1 or more PIMs deprescribed at discharge and the proportion of patients with an adverse drug withdrawal event (ADWE).
Results
A total of 5698 participants (median [range] age, 78 [72-85] years; 2858 [50.2%] women; race and ethnicity data were not collected) were enrolled in 3 clusters and were adjudicated for the primary outcome (control, 3204; intervention, 2494). Despite cluster randomization, there were group imbalances, eg, the participants in the intervention arm were older and had more PIMS prescribed at baseline. After hospital discharge, 4989 (87.6%) participants completed an ADE interview. There was no significant difference in ADEs within 30 days of discharge (138 [5.0%] of 2742 control vs 111 [4.9%] of 2247 intervention participants; adjusted risk difference [aRD] -0.8%; 95% CI, -2.9% to 1.3%). Deprescribing increased from 795 (29.8%) of 2667 control to 1249 (55.4%) of 2256 intervention participants [aRD, 22.2%; 95% CI, 16.9% to 27.4%]. There was no difference in ADWEs between groups. Several post hoc sensitivity analyses, including the use of a nonparametric test to address the low cluster number, group imbalances, and potential biases, did not alter study conclusions.
Conclusions and Relevance
This cluster randomized clinical trial showed that providing deprescribing clinical decision support during acute hospitalization had no demonstrable impact on ADEs, although the intervention was safe and led to improvements in deprescribing.

The findings suggest that collaboration between the intensive care and palliative care team with early palliative assessment may be beneficial in lowering anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms in critically ill stroke patients and their caregivers.","INTRODUCTION
Patients admitted to the Neurocritical Care Unit (NCCU) with moderate-to-severe acute strokes, along with their surrogate decision makers, have the potential for unrecognized or unmet emotional and psychological needs. Our primary objective was to determine if early integration of palliative care consultations within this cohort was feasible and would impact understanding, decision-making and emotional support to patients and their surrogate decision makers. Our secondary objective was to evaluate the long-term impact of early palliative care assessment on the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

METHODS
This was a single center prospective pilot study. Patients with moderate-to-severe ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes were randomized into two arms. The control arm received standard intensive care and the intervention arm received an additional early palliative care consultation within 72 hours of hospitalization. Study assessments with the participants were obtained on day 1-3, and day 5-7 of care with comparisons of total scores on the Questionnaire on Communication (QOC), Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Furthermore, comparisons of HADS and PTSD DSM-5 (PCL- 5) scores were completed at 3 months. Linear mixed effects models were conducted to examine the association between intervention and participant's scores.

RESULTS
A total of 22 participants were enrolled between February 2019 and April 2020. Statistically significant improvement in scores was seen in the total HADS score (p=0.043) and PCL5 score (p=0.033) at 3 months following intervention.

To investigate whether short-term exposure to high temporal frequency full-field flicker has an impact on spatial visual acuity in individuals with varying degrees of myopia.

METHODS
Thirty subjects (evenly divided between control and experimental groups) underwent a 5-min exposure to full-field flicker. The flicker rate was lower than critical flicker frequency (CFF) for the experimental group (12.5 Hz) and significantly higher than CFF for the controls (60 Hz). Spatial contrast sensitivity function (CSF) was measured before and immediately after flicker exposure. We examined whether the post flicker CSF parameters were different from the pre-exposure CSF values in either of the subject groups. Additionally, we examined the relationship between the amount of CSF change from pre to post timepoints and the degree of subjects' myopia. The CSF parameters included peak frequency, peak sensitivity, bandwidth, truncation, and area under log CSF (AULCSF).

RESULTS
There was no significant difference of all five pre-exposure CSF parameters between the two groups at baseline ( P  = 0.333 ∼ 0.424). Experimental group subjects exhibited significant ( P  < 0.005) increases in peak sensitivity and AULCSF, when comparing post-exposure results to pre-exposure ones. Controls showed no such enhancements. Furthermore, the extent of these changes in the experimental group was correlated significantly with the participants' refractive error ( P  = 0.005 and 0.018, respectively).

CONCLUSION
Our data suggest that exposure to perceivable high-frequency flicker (but, not to supra-CFF frequencies) enhances important aspects of spatial contrast sensitivity, and these enhancements are correlated to the degree of myopia. This finding has implications for potential interventions for cases of modest myopia.

A fixed-dose combination (FDC) of gemigliptin/rosuvastatin 50/20 mg as a monolayer tablet has been used to treat patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. To improve the stability of the FDC, a new FDC formulation as a bilayer tablet was developed. This study aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of the FDC of gemigliptin/rosuvastatin 50/20 mg between the newly developed bilayer tablet and the approved monolayer tablet in healthy subjects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, two-way crossover study was conducted. Subjects received a single dose of the FDC of gemigliptin/rosuvastatin 50/20 mg as the bilayer tablet or the monolayer tablet in each period with a 7-day washout. For PK and PD analyses, serial blood samples were collected up to 72 hours after dosing to determine plasma concentrations of gemigliptin, its active metabolite LC15-0636 and rosuvastatin, and plasma dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) activity. PK and PD parameters were calculated using non-compartmental methods and compared between the two formulations.

RESULTS
A total of 48 healthy subjects were randomized, and 45 subjects completed the study. The concentration-time profiles of gemigliptin, LC15-0636 and rosuvastatin were comparable between the two formulations. All geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) of the bilayer tablet to the monolayer tablet for maximum plasma concentration and area under concentration-time curve from 0 to last measurable time point of the three compounds fulfilled the bioequivalence criteria of 0.80-1.25. Likewise, area under plasma DPP-4 activity inhibition from baseline-time curve from 0 to last measurable time point and maximum inhibition of plasma DPP-4 activity were similar between the two formulations.

CONCLUSION
The FDC of gemigliptin/rosuvastatin 50/20 mg as the bilayer tablet showed equivalent PK and PD properties with the FDC of gemigliptin/rosuvastatin 50/20 mg as the monolayer tablet in healthy subjects. These results suggest that the newly developed bilayer tablet can become an alternative formulation to the commercially available monolayer tablet.

Ubrogepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist indicated for acute treatment of migraine that can be used to treat breakthrough attacks in individuals taking preventive treatment for migraine. We evaluated the impact of preventive medication use on the efficacy and safety of ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine.

METHODS
This was an analysis of pooled efficacy data from the ACHIEVE I and ACHIEVE II phase 3 trials, in which efficacy of ubrogepant was assessed at 2 h after taking study medication for pain freedom, absence of most bothersome symptom (MBS), and pain relief. In addition, a long-term safety (LTS) extension trial was completed where safety was assessed on the basis of incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Outcomes were compared between participants with or without prior (within 6 months) preventive medication use (anticonvulsants, beta blockers, antidepressants, or onabotulinumtoxinA). For efficacy analyses, data were pooled across ACHIEVE trials for the 50 mg and placebo groups; for safety analyses, data for all dose groups (50 mg and 100 mg) in the LTS trial were pooled.

RESULTS
Preventive treatments were used by 417 of 2247 (18.6%) participants analyzed in the ACHIEVE trials and by 143 of 813 (17.5%) participants in the LTS trial. Responder rates for all outcomes were similar between participants with or without preventive treatment within each dose group (p > 0.05). No significant differences were noted across the different preventive medications. Rates and types of TEAEs were similar between participants with or without preventive treatment. No serious treatment-related adverse events were reported.

CONCLUSION
Efficacy and safety of ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine were similar between participants with or without prior or current use of concomitant preventive medication.

67,"Compared to tertile 1, the risk of new-onset AF was 2.5-fold higher in tertile 2, and 6.3-fold higher in tertile 3.","The COMMANDER-HF trial enrolled 5022 patients with heart failure and a low ejection fraction who did not have atrial fibrillation at baseline. The trial found that risk of new-onset AF was associated with age, low ejection fraction, history of PCI or CABG, White race, low systolic blood pressure, and high BMI. A risk score was developed from these variables with an accuracy of 0.71. Patients with higher risk scores had greater likelihood of developing AF and those who did had an increased risk of death. Rivaroxaban did not reduce the risk of AF.","BACKGROUND
Atrial fibrillation (AF) in the presence of heart failure (HF) is associated with poor outcomes including a high-risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events. Identifying patients without AF who are at high-risk of developing this arrhythmia has important clinical implications.

AIMS
To develop a risk score to identify HF patients at high risk of developing AF.

METHODS
The COMMANDER-HF trial enrolled 5022 patients with HF and a LVEF ≤ 40%, history of coronary artery disease, and absence of AF at baseline (confirmed with an electrocardiogram). Patients were randomized to either rivaroxaban (2.5 mg bid) or placebo. New-onset AF was confirmed by the investigator at study visits.

RESULTS
241 (4.8%) patients developed AF during the follow-up (median 21 months). Older age (≥ 65 years), LVEF < 35%, history of PCI or CABG, White race, SBP < 110 mmHg, and higher BMI (≥ 25 kg/m 2 ) were independently associated with risk of new-onset AF, whereas the use of DAPT was associated with a lower risk of new-onset AF. We then built a risk score from these variables (with good accuracy C-index = 0.71) and calibration across observed and predicted tertiles of risk. New-onset AF events rates increased steeply by increasing tertiles of the risk-score. Compared to tertile 1, the risk of new-onset AF was 2.5-fold higher in tertile 2, and 6.3-fold higher in tertile 3. Rivaroxaban had no effect in reducing new-onset AF. In time-updated models, new-onset AF was associated with a higher risk of subsequent all-cause death: HR (95%CI) 1.38 (1.11-1.73).

CONCLUSIONS
A well-calibrated risk-score identified patients at risk of new-onset AF in the COMMANDER-HF trial. Patients who developed AF had a higher risk of subsequent death. Risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with HFrEF and coronary artery disease.

Additionally, the safety profile of SFOH was found to be consistent with that of calcium acetate, with similar proportions of subjects reporting adverse events in both groups, and withdrawal due to adverse events being more common with calcium acetate.","BACKGROUND
Pediatric patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often prescribed oral phosphate binders (PBs) for the management of hyperphosphatemia. However, available PBs have limitations, including unfavorable tolerability and safety.

METHODS
This phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label study investigated safety and efficacy of sucroferric oxyhydroxide (SFOH) in pediatric and adolescent subjects with CKD and hyperphosphatemia. Subjects were randomized to SFOH or calcium acetate (CaAc) for a 10-week dose titration (stage 1), followed by a 24-week safety extension (stage 2). Primary efficacy endpoint was change in serum phosphorus from baseline to the end of stage 1 in the SFOH group. Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

RESULTS
Eighty-five subjects (2-18 years) were randomized and treated (SFOH, n = 66; CaAc, n = 19). Serum phosphorus reduction from baseline to the end of stage 1 in the overall SFOH group (least squares [LS] mean ± standard error [SE]) was - 0.488 ± 0.186 mg/dL; p = 0.011 (post hoc analysis). Significant reductions in serum phosphorus were observed in subjects aged ≥ 12 to ≤ 18 years (LS mean ± SE - 0.460 ± 0.195 mg/dL; p = 0.024) and subjects with serum phosphorus above age-related normal ranges at baseline (LS mean ± SE - 0.942 ± 0.246 mg/dL; p = 0.005). Similar proportions of subjects reported ≥ 1 TEAE in the SFOH (75.8%) and CaAc (73.7%) groups. Withdrawal due to TEAEs was more common with CaAc (31.6%) than with SFOH (18.2%).

CONCLUSIONS
SFOH effectively managed serum phosphorus in pediatric patients with a low pill burden and a safety profile consistent with that reported in adult patients.

The aim of the study was to compare preservation of pulp vitality by indirect pulp treatment with calcium hydroxide, calcium silicate based cement (Biodentine) and Er,Cr:YSGG laser in permanent molars.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
30 patients were selected for this study as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the age group of 6-14 years and then randomly allocated to three groups A, B & C. In group A, after caries excavation, calcium hydroxide (Dycal) was placed at the floor. In group B, after caries excavation, calcium silicate based cement (Biodentine) was placed at the floor. In group C, after caries excavation, decontamination of the cavity was done with Er,Cr:YSGG laser. This was followed by placement of permanent restorative material in all the groups. Clinical and radiographic success was monitored at 3, 6 and months. Data analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Science-21 (SPSS-21).

70,"None of the aortic stiffness measures changed significantly in the aerobic exercise training-only or aerobic exercise training plus more intensive CR groups, and there were no significant changes in any other measure of aortic structure or function in these groups.","In this study, 160 older adults with obesity were assigned to three groups: aerobic exercise only, aerobic exercise with moderate caloric restriction, or aerobic exercise with more intensive caloric restriction. Results showed that the greatest improvements in aortic stiffness were found in the aerobic exercise with moderate caloric restriction group, with increased distensibility and decreased pulse wave velocity. Increases in aortic distensibility were correlated with improvements in body weight and body fat distribution, but these associations were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. These results suggest that combining aerobic exercise with moderate caloric restriction may be more effective than exercise alone in improving aortic stiffness in older adults with obesity.","BACKGROUND
Obesity may accelerate age-related increases in aortic stiffness. Although aerobic exercise training generally has favorable effects on aortic structure and function, exercise alone may not be sufficient to improve aortic stiffness in older adults with obesity. We determined the effects of aerobic exercise training with and without moderate- to high-caloric restriction (CR) on the structure and function of the proximal aorta in 160 older (65-79 years) men and women with obesity (body mass index=30-45 kg/m 2 ).

METHODS
Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: aerobic exercise training only (treadmill 4 days/week for 30 minutes at 65% to 70% of heart rate reserve; n=56), aerobic exercise training plus moderate CR (n=55), or aerobic exercise training plus more intensive CR (n=49) for 20 weeks. Aortic pulse wave velocity, aortic distensibility, and other measures of aortic structure and function were assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Pearson correlation coefficients were examined to assess associations between changes in proximal aortic stiffness and changes in fitness, fatness, and other potential confounders.

RESULTS
Weight loss in the aerobic exercise training plus moderate CR (-8.0 kg [95% CI, -9.17 to -6.87]) and aerobic exercise training plus more intensive CR (-8.98 kg [95% CI, -10.23 to -7.73) groups was significantly greater compared with the aerobic exercise training-only group (-1.66 kg [95% CI, -2.94 to -0.38];  P <0.017 for both). There were significant treatment effects for descending aorta distensibility ( P =0.008) and strain ( P =0.004) and aortic arch pulse wave velocity ( P =0.01) with the aerobic exercise training plus moderate CR group having a 21% increase in distensibility ( P =0.016) and an 8% decrease in pulse wave velocity ( P =0.058). None of the aortic stiffness measures changed significantly in the aerobic exercise training-only or aerobic exercise training plus more intensive CR groups, and there were no significant changes in any other measure of aortic structure or function in these groups. Overall, increases in aortic distensibility were correlated with improvements in body weight and body fat distribution, but these associations were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons.

CONCLUSIONS
In older adults with obesity, combining aerobic exercise with moderate CR leads to greater improvements in proximal aortic stiffness than exercise alone. Registration: URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT01048736.

The results showed that the approach bias towards high-calorie food was significantly decreased only in the 45-minute exercise session, compared to the 60-minute exercise session and the control session.

Prior data has demonstrated increased mortality in hospitalized patients with acute heart failure (AHF) and troponin elevation. No data has specifically examined the prognostic significance of troponin elevation in patients with AHF discharged after emergency department (ED) management.
Objective
Evaluate the relationship between troponin elevation and outcomes in patients with AHF who are treated and released from the ED.
Methods
This was a secondary analysis of the Get with the Guidelines to Reduce Disparities in AHF Patients Discharged from the ED (GUIDED-HF) trial, a randomized, controlled trial of ED patients with AHF who were discharged. Patients with elevated conventional troponin not due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were included. Our primary outcome was a composite endpoint: time to 30-day cardiovascular death and/or heart failure-related events.
Results
Of the 491 subjects included in the GUIDED-HF trial, 418 had troponin measured during the ED evaluation and 66 (16%) had troponin values above the 99th percentile. Median age was 63 years (interquartile range, 54-70), 62% (n = 261) were male, 63% (n = 265) were Black, and 16% (n = 67) experienced our primary outcome.

To evaluate the efficacy of brief psychotherapeutic interventions of cognitive behavioral therapy to treat antenatal depression and verify the association between interventions and motor development of infants at 3 and 18 months of age.

METHODS
Pre-post-intervention study nested a randomized clinical trial, both of which are extracts from a population-based cohort study of a southern Brazilian city. The major depressive episode was measured through Mini Plus, the severity of depressive symptoms by BDI-II and motor development using Bayley-III and AIMS. The follow-ups occurred during the gestational period (T2) and at 3 (T3) and 18 months (T4) after delivery.

RESULTS
Data were analyzed from 336 women in the control group (not intervened) and 108 from the group of depressed women who received intervention for antenatal depression. The effectiveness of the interventions for a major depressive episode was around 80% for both models in the two follow-up stages (3 and 18 months postpartum).

Results showed that there was no significant difference in the progression of AVC between the intervention and placebo groups, and no differences in rate of heart valve surgery, all-cause death, or cardiovascular events. However, MK-7 plus vitamin D had a significant reduction in dp-ucMGP compared to placebo.","BACKGROUND
Menaquinone-7 (MK-7), also known as vitamin K2, is a cofactor for the carboxylation of proteins involved in the inhibition of arterial calcification and has been suggested to reduce the progression rate of aortic valve calcification (AVC) in patients with aortic stenosis.

METHODS
In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, men from the community with an AVC score >300 arbitrary units (AU) on cardiac noncontrast computer tomography were randomized to daily treatment with tablet 720 µg MK-7 plus 25 µg vitamin D or matching placebo for 24 months. The primary outcome was the change in AVC score. Selected secondary outcomes included change in aortic valve area and peak aortic jet velocity on echocardiography, heart valve surgery, change in aortic and coronary artery calcification, and change in dp-ucMGP (dephosphorylated-undercarboxylated matrix Gla-protein). Safety outcomes included all-cause death and cardiovascular events.

RESULTS
From February 1, 2018, to March 21, 2019, 365 men were randomized. Mean age was 71.0 (±4.4) years. The mean (95% CI) increase in AVC score was 275 AU (95% CI, 225-326 AU) and 292 AU (95% CI, 246-338 AU) in the intervention and placebo groups, respectively. The mean difference on AVC progression was 17 AU (95% CI, -86 to 53 AU;  P =0.64). The mean change in aortic valve area was 0.02 cm 2  (95% CI, -0.09 to 0.12 cm 2 ;  P =0.78) and in peak aortic jet velocity was 0.04 m/s (95% CI, -0.11 to 0.02 m/s;  P =0.21). The progression in aortic and coronary artery calcification score was not significantly different between patients treated with MK-7 plus vitamin D and patients receiving placebo. There was no difference in the rate of heart valve surgery (1 versus 2 patients;  P =0.99), all-cause death (1 versus 4 patients;  P =0.37), or cardiovascular events (10 versus 10 patients;  P =0.99). Compared with patients in the placebo arm, a significant reduction in dp-ucMGP was observed with MK-7 plus vitamin D (-212 pmol/L versus 45 pmol/L;  P <0.001).

CONCLUSIONS
In elderly men with an AVC score >300 AU, 2 years MK-7 plus vitamin D supplementation did not influence AVC progression.

Epithelial barrier dysfunction contributes to a dysregulated intestinal immune response in ulcerative colitis (UC). GB004 is an orally administered, small molecule, gut-targeted stabiliser of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, a transcription factor with protective roles at the epithelial layer of the inflamed gut.

AIMS
To evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of GB004 in patients with active UC.

METHODS
This double-blind, placebo-controlled study randomised patients 2:1 to receive an oral solution of GB004 120 mg or placebo once daily for 28 days. Eligible patients had a Robarts Histopathology Index score ≥4 with neutrophils in the epithelium, total Mayo Clinic score 3-12, Mayo Clinic endoscopic subscore ≥1, and blood in the stool, despite treatment with 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids or immunosuppressants.

RESULTS
Thirty-four patients were randomised. GB004 120 mg for 28 days was generally well-tolerated. Adverse events occurred in 27.3% (3/11) and 39.1% (9/23) of patients in the placebo and GB004 groups respectively. Nausea and dysgeusia were most commonly reported in the GB004 group (0% for placebo and 21.7% [5/23] and 13.0% [3/23] respectively for GB004). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events or deaths. GB004 exhibited minimal accumulation, with higher colonic concentrations relative to plasma.

However, its effects on spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations of brain activity are still poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigated the frontopolar tDCS effects on resting-state brain activity and connectivity. Twelve healthy participants were recruited and received anode, cathode, and sham stimulation in a randomized order. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after stimulation. Functional connectivity was calculated to examine tDCS effects within and beyond the frontopolar network. To assess the frequency-dependent changes of brain activity, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) was computed in the slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) bands. The results showed anodal tDCS-induced widespread connectivity reduction within and beyond the frontopolar network. Regardless of tDCS polarity, stimulation effect on fALFF was significantly larger in slow-5 band compared with the slow-4. Notably, anodal tDCS-induced connectivity changes were associated with pre-tDCS fALFF in slow-4 band, showing positive correlations in the frontal regions and negative correlations in the temporal regions. Our findings imply that tDCS-induced brain alterations may be frequency-dependent, and pre-tDCS regional brain activity could be used to predict post-tDCS connectivity changes.","Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a way to help the brain work better without surgery.

Redo ablation procedures were required in 31% (16 of 52) of GPA and 24% (12 of 50) of PVI patients.","BACKGROUND
The ganglionated plexuses (GPs) of the intrinsic cardiac autonomic system may play a role in atrial fibrillation (AF).

OBJECTIVE
We hypothesized that ablating the ectopy-triggering GPs (ET-GPs) prevents AF.

METHODS
GANGLIA-AF (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02487654) was a prospective, randomized, controlled, 3-center trial. ET-GPs were mapped using high frequency stimulation, delivered within the atrial refractory period and ablated until nonfunctional. If triggered AF became incessant, atrioventricular dissociating GPs were ablated. We compared GP ablation (GPA) without pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) against PVI in patients with paroxysmal AF. Follow-up was for 12 months including 3-monthly 48-hour Holter monitors. The primary end point was documented ≥30 seconds of atrial arrhythmia after a 3-month blanking period.

RESULTS
A total of 102 randomized patients were analyzed on a per-protocol basis after GPA (n = 52; 51%) or PVI (n = 50; 49%). Patients who underwent GPA had 89 ± 26 high frequency stimulation sites tested, identifying a median of 18.5% (interquartile range 16%-21%) of GPs. The radiofrequency ablation time was 22.9 ± 9.8 minutes in GPA and 38 ± 14.4 minutes in PVI (P < .0001). The freedom from ≥30 seconds of atrial arrhythmia at 12-month follow-up was 50% (26 of 52) with GPA vs 64% (32 of 50) with PVI (log-rank, P = .09). ET-GPA without atrioventricular dissociating GPA achieved 58% (22 of 38) freedom from the primary end point. There was a significantly higher reduction in antiarrhythmic drug usage postablation after GPA than after PVI (55.5% vs 36%; P = .05). Patients were referred for redo ablation procedures in 31% (16 of 52) after GPA and 24% (12 of 50) after PVI (P = .53).

CONCLUSION
GPA did not prevent atrial arrhythmias more than PVI. However, less radiofrequency ablation was delivered to achieve a higher reduction in antiarrhythmic drug usage with GPA than with PVI.
","This study was done to see if a procedure called ablating the ectopy-triggering ganglionated plexuses (ET-GPs) can help prevent a heart rhythm problem called atrial fibrillation (AF).

78,There was a significant change in the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of xanthine and uric acid before surgery (p < 0.01).,"This study investigated the effects of preoperative administration of allopurinol (300mg) versus placebo on postoperative pain and anxiety in patients undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy. Results showed that allopurinol was effective in reducing postoperative pain 2 hours after surgery, with a 40% reduction in pain scores compared to placebo (p<0.05). There were no differences in anxiety scores, and there was a significant change in cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of xanthine and uric acid (p<0.01). The findings suggest that allopurinol may be a viable preanesthetic medication for reducing postoperative pain.","PURPOSE
Allopurinol is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase used primarily in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of preanesthetic allopurinol versus placebo on postoperative pain and anxiety in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy.

METHODS
This is a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. We investigated 54 patients scheduled to undergo elective abdominal hysterectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral allopurinol 300 mg (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) the night before and 1 h before surgery. Patients were submitted to evaluation of pain and anxiety before the treatment, for 24 h postoperatively, 30 and 90 days after surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected at the time of the spinal anesthesia to perform the measurement of the central levels of purines.

RESULTS
Preoperative administration of allopurinol was effective in reducing postoperative pain 2 h after surgery. Allopurinol caused a reduction of approximately 40% in pain scores measured by the visual analogue pain scale after surgery (p < 0.05). No differences were found between groups in anxiety scores after surgery. There was a significant change in the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of xanthine and uric acid before surgery (p < 0.01).

CONCLUSION
This study showed a short-term benefit of the use of allopurinol as a preanesthetic medication since it was related to a reduction on pain scores 2 h after surgery. The purinergic system is a potential target for new analgesic drugs. New studies investigating more selective purine derivatives in the management of pain should be performed.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is defined as an association of chronic abdominal pain with bowel habit abnormalities, without clear organic dysfunction. T-type calcium channels and low-grade mucosal inflammation are linked to abdominal pain; however, medical treatments for IBS abdominal pain are largely ineffective. In this study, we investigated if pentoxifylline (PTX) and ethosuximide could potentially alleviate abdominal pain in patients with IBS treated with mebeverine.

METHODS
We recruited 150 patients from Tanta University Hospital to this randomized, prospective, and double blinded study. Patients were randomly allocated to three groups (n = 50). Group 1 (mebeverine) received 135 mg mebeverine three times/day (t.i.d). Group 2 (ethosuximide group) received 135 mg mebeverine t.i.d plus 250 mg ethosuximide twice daily (b.i.d) and group 3 (PTX group) received 135 mg mebeverine t.i.d plus 400 mg PTX b.i.d. Patients were assessed by a gastroenterologist at baseline and 6 months after therapy. Serum interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-6, tumor necrosis-α (TNF-α), fecal myeloperoxidase, and fecal neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels were measured before and after therapy. The numeric pain rating scale (NRS) was also assessed before and after therapy.

PRIMARY OUTCOMES
Reduced NRS scores and abdominal pain relief.

SECONDARY OUTCOMES
Decreased inflammatory biomarkers.

RESULTS
After 6 months, groups 2 and 3 showed a significantly greater reduction in serum IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, fecal myeloperoxidase, and fecal NGAL levels when compared to group 1 after therapy. Both groups 2 and 3 showed significant reductions in NRS scores when compared to the group 1.

CONCLUSION
Ethosuximide and PTX may be promising, novel adjunct drugs to antispasmodics for relieving abdominal pain in patients with IBS.

Many employers use workplace wellness programs to improve employee health and reduce medical costs, but randomized evaluations of their efficacy are rare.
Objective
To evaluate the effect of a comprehensive workplace wellness program on employee health, health beliefs, and medical use after 12 and 24 months.
Design, Setting, and Participants
This randomized clinical trial of 4834 employees of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign was conducted from August 9, 2016, to April 26, 2018. Members of the treatment group (n = 3300) received incentives to participate in the workplace wellness program. Members of the control group (n = 1534) did not participate in the wellness program. Statistical analysis was performed on April 9, 2020.
Interventions
The 2-year workplace wellness program included financial incentives and paid time off for annual on-site biometric screenings, annual health risk assessments, and ongoing wellness activities (eg, physical activity, smoking cessation, and disease management).
Main Outcomes and Measures
Measures taken at 12 and 24 months included clinician-collected biometrics (16 outcomes), administrative claims related to medical diagnoses (diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia) and medical use (office visits, inpatient visits, and emergency department visits), and self-reported health behaviors and health beliefs (14 outcomes).
Results
Among the 4834 participants (2770 women; mean [SD] age, 43.9 [11.3] years), no significant effects of the program on biometrics, medical diagnoses, or medical use were seen after 12 or 24 months. A significantly higher proportion of employees in the treatment group than in the control group reported having a primary care physician after 24 months (1106 of 1200 [92.2%] vs 477 of 554 [86.1%]; adjusted P = .002). The intervention significantly improved a set of employee health beliefs on average: participant beliefs about their chance of having a body mass index greater than 30, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and impaired glucose level jointly decreased by 0.07 SDs (95% CI, -0.12 to -0.01 SDs; P = .02); however, effects on individual belief measures were not significant.
Conclusions and Relevance
This randomized clinical trial showed that a comprehensive workplace wellness program had no significant effects on measured physical health outcomes, rates of medical diagnoses, or the use of health care services after 24 months, but it increased the proportion of employees reporting that they have a primary care physician and improved employee beliefs about their own health.

The primary aims are to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the two groups, and the secondary aim is to explore the relative efficacy of the two groups compared to the control group. The study has been approved by the Health Research Authority of the NHS in the UK, and the results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations and social media.","BACKGROUND
Acquired brain injury (ABI) affects approximately 79.3 million individuals annually and is linked with elevated rates of depression and low mood. Existing methods for treating depression in ABI have shown mixed efficacy. Behavioural activation (BA) is a potentially promising intervention. Its premise is that individuals with low mood avoid planning and engaging in activities due to low expectations of a positive outcome. Consequently, their exposure to positive reinforcement is reduced, exacerbating low mood. BA aims to break this cycle by encouraging activity planning and engagement. It is unknown whether cognitive demands of traditional BA may undermine efficacy in ABI. Here, we assess the feasibility and acceptability of two groups designed to increase activity engagement. In the activity planning group (traditional BA), the importance of meaningful and positive activity will be discussed and participants encouraged to plan/engage in activities in everyday life. The activity engagement group (experiential BA) instead focuses on engagement in positive experiences (crafts, games, discussion)  within  the group. The primary aims are to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the two groups in ABI. A secondary aim is to explore relative efficacy of the groups compared to an equivalent period of waitlist controls.

METHOD
This study outlines a parallel-arm pilot feasibility trial for individuals with low mood and ABI that compares a traditional vs experiential BA group vs waitlist controls. Adults (≥ 18 years) will be recruited from local ABI services and randomised to condition. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed via recruitment, retention, attendance and participant feedback. Groups will be compared (pre- and post-intervention and 1 month follow-up) by assessing self-reported activity engagement. Secondary outcomes include self-report measures of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic distress related to the ABI, motivation, participation and sense of control over one's life.

ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION
The trial has been approved by the Health Research Authority of the NHS in the UK (East of England-Cambridge Central, REF 18/EE/0305). Results will inform future research on interventions for mood in ABI and be disseminated broadly via peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations and social media.

Secondary outcomes, such as time to full suck feeds and brain injury score, showed little difference.","Importance
Seizures in the neonatal period are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Bedside amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) has facilitated the detection of electrographic seizures; however, whether these seizures should be treated remains uncertain.
Objective
To determine if the active management of electrographic and clinical seizures in encephalopathic term or near-term neonates improves survival free of severe disability at 2 years of age compared with only treating clinically detected seizures.
Design, Setting, and Participants
This randomized clinical trial was conducted in tertiary newborn intensive care units recruited from 2012 to 2016 and followed up until 2 years of age. Participants included neonates with encephalopathy at 35 weeks' gestation or more and younger than 48 hours old. Data analysis was completed in April 2021.
Interventions
Randomization was to an electrographic seizure group (ESG) in which seizures detected on aEEG were treated in addition to clinical seizures or a clinical seizure group (CSG) in which only seizures detected clinically were treated.
Main Outcomes and Measures
Primary outcome was death or severe disability at 2 years, defined as scores in any developmental domain more than 2 SD below the Australian mean assessed with Bayley Scales of Neonate and Toddler Development, 3rd ed (BSID-III), or the presence of cerebral palsy, blindness, or deafness. Secondary outcomes included magnetic resonance imaging brain injury score at 5 to 14 days, time to full suck feeds, and individual domain scores on BSID-III at 2 years.
Results
Of 212 randomized neonates, the mean (SD) gestational age was 39.2 (1.7) weeks and 122 (58%) were male; 152 (72%) had moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and 147 (84%) had electrographic seizures. A total of 86 neonates were included in the ESG group and 86 were included in the CSG group. Ten of 86 (9%) neonates in the ESG and 4 of 86 (4%) in the CSG died before the 2-year assessment. The odds of the primary outcome were not significantly different in the ESG group compared with the CSG group (ESG, 38 of 86 [44%] vs CSG, 27 of 86 [31%]; odds ratio [OR], 1.83; 95% CI, 0.96 to 3.49; P = .14). There was also no significant difference in those with HIE (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 0.84 to 3.73; P = .26). There was evidence that cognitive outcomes were worse in the ESG (mean [SD] scores, ESG: 97.4 [17.7] vs CSG: 103.8 [17.3]; mean difference, -6.5 [95% CI, -1.2 to -11.8]; P = .01). There was little evidence of a difference in secondary outcomes, including time to suck feeds, seizure burden, or brain injury score.
Conclusions and Relevance
Treating electrographic and clinical seizures with currently used anticonvulsants did not significantly reduce the rate of death or disability at 2 years in a heterogeneous group of neonates with seizures.

This study aimed to assess the known-groups validity of the EQ-5D-5L and the ICEpop Capability Measure for Older People (ICECAP-O), 2 outcome measures used in economic evaluation, among older adults with depressive symptoms in socioeconomically deprived areas of Brazil. We also explored the role of education and income on responses to these measures.

METHODS
This cross-sectional study used baseline data from PROACTIVE, a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate a psychosocial intervention for late-life depression among older adults. Participants aged ≥60 years with a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score ≥10 were recruited from 20 primary healthcare clinics. Ordered logistic regression models assessed the association between depressive symptoms severity, income, and education and dimension-level responses on the EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O. Multivariable regression models investigated the ability of EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O scores to discriminate between depressive symptoms severity levels and other characteristics, including education level and household income.

RESULTS
A total of 715 participants were included in the study. Depressive symptoms severity was associated with all EQ-5D-5L and ICECAP-O dimensions, except the ICECAP-O enjoyment attribute. In contrast, household income was only associated with the ICECAP-O security attribute. Higher severity of depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores) was also strongly associated with lower (ie, worse) scores on both measures in all models. Education level and household income showed no association with either EQ-5D-5L or ICECAP-O scores.

To assess the ability of a health information technology system to facilitate population- based breast cancer screening.

STUDY DESIGN
Cohort study with 2-year follow-up after a 1-year cluster randomized trial.

METHODS
Study population was women 42 to 69 years old receiving care within a 12-practice primary care network. The management informatics system (1) identified women overdue for mammograms, (2) connected them to primary care providers using a web-based tool, (3) created automatically generated outreach letters for patients specified by providers, (4) monitored for subsequent mammography scheduling and completion, and (5) provided practice delegates with a list of women remaining unscreened for reminder phone calls. Eligible women overdue for a mammogram during a 1-year study period included those overdue at study start (prevalent cohort) and those who became overdue during follow-up (incident cohort). The main outcome measure was mammography completion rates over 3 years.

RESULTS
Among 32,688 eligible women, 9795 (30%) were overdue for screening (4487 intervention, 5308 control). Intervention patients were somewhat younger, more likely to be non-Hispanic white, and more likely to have health insurance compared with control patients. Adjusted completion rates in the prevalent cohort (n = 6697) were significantly higher among intervention patients after 3 years (51.7% vs 45.8%; P = .002). For patients in the incident cohort (n = 3098), adjusted completion rates after 2 years were 53.8% versus 48.7%, respectively (P = .052).

CONCLUSIONS
Population-based informatics systems can enable sustained increases in mammography screening rates beyond rates seen with office-based visit reminders.

Demodex infestations cause blepharitis and are difficult to treat. Recently, a new type of eyelid wipes with terpenoids has been found effective. We aim to evaluate patient satisfaction after short-term use and compare two teaching modalities on the techniques of use.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Eligible participants were taught to use eyelid wipes (Cliradex ® ) by either live or online video demonstration based on random allocation. Participants used the wipes twice daily for a week. All participants had prior evaluation of socioeconomic status, dry eye symptoms, and meibomian gland features. After 1 week, competence of use was assessed by participants showing their technique to the investigator, and a questionnaire on comfort, ease, and convenience of use was administered. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction, and these levels are compared among the two teaching modalities using chi square.

RESULTS
A total of 50 participants were recruited, with a mean age of 42±16 years, and 88% of the participants were females. Overall, median comfort level was 4.0 (range: 1-6), ease level was 5.0 (3-6), and convenience level was 5.0 (2-6). Median stinging was 2.0 (1-4), which corresponded to some but mild stinging. The median competence level was 4.0 (2-4), which corresponded to excellent competence. These satisfactory levels (ease, comfort, and convenience) experienced were not significantly associated with different socioeconomic indicators, that is, housing type, income, highest education level, and were not different between teaching methods ( p >0.05).

CONCLUSION
Short-term use of Cliradex eyelid wipes seems to be acceptable to most people. The teaching instructions before using these wipes were equally effective - whether live or online video demonstration was used.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between self-identified race and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and response to therapy among patients enrolled in the randomized Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB)/SWOG 80405 trial.

METHODS
Patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer who were enrolled in the CALGB/SWOG 80405 trial were identified by race. On the basis of covariates (treatment arm, KRAS status, sex, age, and body mass index), each Black patient was exact matched with a White patient. The association between race and OS and PFS was examined using a marginal Cox proportional hazard model for matched pairs. The interaction between KRAS status and race was tested in the model. The association between race and response to therapy and adverse events were examined using a marginal logistic regression model.

RESULTS
In total, 392 patients were matched and included in the final data set. No difference in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.16), PFS (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.78-1.20), or response to therapy (odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.65-1.52) was observed between Black and White patients. Patients with KRAS mutant status (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.67), a performance statusscore of 1 (reference, a performance status of 0; HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18-1.88), or ≥3 metastatic sites (reference, 1 metastatic site; HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.22-2.28) experienced worse OS. Black patients experienced lower rates and risk of grade ≥3 fatigue (6.6% vs 13.3%; OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.91) but were equally likely to be treated with a dose reduction (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.72-1.65).

CONCLUSIONS
No difference in OS, PFS, or response to therapy was observed between Black patients and White patients in an equal treatment setting of the CALGB/SWOG 80405 randomized controlled trial.

LAY SUMMARY
Despite improvements in screening and treatment, studies have demonstrated worse outcomes in Black patients with colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a difference in cancer-specific outcomes among Black and White patients receiving equivalent treatment on the CALGB/SWOG 80405 randomized clinical trial. In this study, there was no difference in overall survival, progression-free survival, or response to therapy between Black and White patients treated on a clinical trial. These findings suggest that access to care and differences in treatment may be responsible for racial disparities in colorectal cancer.
","This study looked at the differences in how Black and White people with colorectal cancer respond to treatment. They wanted to see if there was a difference in how people with the same type of cancer and receiving the same treatment fared between Black and White patients. The study found that there was no difference in how long people lived, how long it took for the cancer to get worse, or how well people responded to the treatment. This suggests that the differences in how Black and White people with colorectal cancer fare may be because of access to care or differences in treatment.",Agree,The population is underspecified,"The intervention is mentioned, and described accurately",The outcome is underspecified,Minor omission(s),Minor error,Agree,Agree,Strongly agree,"The population is mentioned, and described accurately",The intervention is underspecified,"The outcome is mentioned, and described accurately",Minor omission(s),No errors,Agree,Agree,Mostly all,Agree,121,,Omits sample size,"Omits description of specific measurements of high-level outcomes (i.e., does not describe how something was measured, for instance using a specific survey to measure quality of life)",1.- First and last sentence do not appear in the abstract. 2.- Outcomes should be more specified,,,,Other,,
88,"Serum total ANGPTL8 did not significantly differ between the two intervention groups at baseline, and it was significantly lower after weight loss, with comparable changes with diet only and diet plus physical activity.","This study sought to investigate the effect of weight loss on total angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) concentrations in northern Americans with obesity but without diabetes. The results showed that serum total ANGPTL8 was higher in the group with obesity than in the lean control group and positively correlated with waist circumference, BMI, fasting insulin, and other factors. After 6-month lifestyle modification, serum total ANGPTL8 was significantly lower, with similar results for diet only and diet plus physical activity groups. These findings indicate that weight loss can reduce circulating total ANGPTL8 concentrations.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS
The primary goals of this study were to clarify 1) the effect of weight loss by lifestyle intervention on circulating total angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8), and 2) the role of physical activity on serum total ANGPTL8 in northern Americans with obesity but without diabetes.

METHODS AND RESULTS
A total of 130 subjects with body mass index (BMI) ≧ 35 kg/m 2  but without diabetes were recruited, and 121 subjects completed a weight loss program for data analysis. Abdominal adipose tissue was determined by non-contrast computed tomography (CT). Serum total ANGPTL8 was higher in the group with obesity than in the lean control group. Serum total ANGPTL8 was positively correlated with waist circumference (WC), BMI, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B, QUICKI, hs-CRP, IL-6, and leptin. Serum total ANGPTL8 did not significantly differ between the two intervention groups at baseline, and it was significantly lower after weight loss, with comparable changes with diet only and diet plus physical activity.

CONCLUSION
Among northern Americans with obesity but without diabetes, a lifestyle modification resulted in significant reduction of circulating total ANGPTL8 concentrations in a 6-month weight-loss period. Although addition of physical activity resulted in greater total and liver fat loss, it did not promote further significant decline of serum total ANGPTL8 beyond diet alone.

The protein was also related to their waist circumference, body mass index, fasting insulin, and other things. After the weight loss program, the protein levels decreased for those who only did diet changes and those who did diet and exercise.

To evaluate long-term reproductive outcomes in couples who were enrolled in a large randomized controlled trial that studied optimal treatment for unexplained infertility.

DESIGN
Telephone survey, administered between March 2019 and February 2020.

SETTING
Large urban university-affiliated fertility center.

PATIENT(S)
Couples who enrolled in the Fast Track and Standard Treatment Trial (FASTT).

INTERVENTION(S)
None.

MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE(S)
Number of live births, methods of conception, adoption, and satisfaction regarding family size.

RESULT(S)
Of the 503 couples enrolled in FASTT, 311 (61.8%) were contacted and 286 (56.9%) consented to participate. The mean age and follicle-stimulating hormone level at the time of enrollment in FASTT were 33.1 ± 3.2 years and 6.8 ± 2.2 mIU/mL, respectively, for those who participated in this study. The mean age at follow-up was 49.5 ± 3.4 years. Of the 286 women, 194 (67.8%) had a live birth during the trial and 225 (78.7%) continued to try to conceive after FASTT. Of those who tried to conceive without treatment, 101 of 157 (64.3%) had a successful live birth, whereas 12 (5.3%) women had a live birth via intrauterine insemination and 82 (36.4%) via autologous oocyte in vitro fertilization. Overall, 182 (80.9%) women achieved a live birth after FASTT.

CONCLUSION(S)
The majority of couples were able to achieve a live birth after FASTT. Only 19 (6.6%) never achieved a live birth during their reproductive years. Moving to treatment sooner allows the opportunity to achieve >1 live birth, which is associated with increased satisfaction regarding family size. This further supports access to care and insurance coverage for infertility treatment.

In this study, we compared effectiveness of two doses of dexmedetomidine (0.15 μg/kg and 0.3 μg/kg) in preventing desflurane-induced emergence agitation (EA) in pediatric patients undergoing elective cataract surgery.

METHODS
It is a prospective double-blinded randomized study conducted on 65 American Society of Anesthesiologists 1 children (2-10 years) who underwent elective cataract surgery at our institute. They were randomized into two equal groups, who received either dexmedetomidine 0.15 μg/kg (Group D 0.15 ) or dexmedetomidine 0.30 μg/kg (Group D 0.3 ) intravenously after induction of anesthesia. An observer blinded to groups recorded heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and respiratory rate (RR) at regular intervals and evaluated preoperative anxiety, state of agitation, and postoperative pain using validated scores.

RESULTS
Both groups (Group D 0.15 ,  n  = 27 vs. Group D 0.3 ,  n  = 26) were demographically identical. In intraoperative period, the difference in HRs was significantly lower in Group D 0 . 3  from 5 min till 15 min of the surgery ( P  < 0.05), but thereafter, from 20 min till end of surgery, the rates were comparable in both the groups, whereas RR and blood pressure fluctuations were comparable throughout.

However, generalized brain edema and midline shift had a significant influence on misplacements, and patients taking oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy had an increased risk of EVD-associated hemorrhage. The results suggest that metal needles and polyurethane catheters are equally safe when there are no midline shift and generalized brain edema.","BACKGROUND
External ventricular drainage (EVD) is one of the most common neurosurgical procedures in emergencies. This study aims to find out which factors influence the occurrence of EVD-related complications in a comparative investigation of metal needles and polyurethane catheters. This is the first clinical study comparing these two systems.

METHODS
Adult patients undergoing pre-coronal EVD placement via freehand burr hole trepanation were included in this prospective study. The exclusion criteria were the open EVD insertion and/or a pre-existing infectious disease of the central nervous system.

RESULTS
Two hundred consecutive patients were enrolled. Of these, 100 patients were treated by using metal EVD (group 1) and 100 patients with polyurethane catheters (group 2). The overall complication rate was 26% (misplacement 13.5%, hemorrhage 12.5%, infection 2.5%, and dislocation 1%) without statistically significant differences between both groups.

CONCLUSION
Generalized brain edema has a significant influence on misplacements in both groups. Midline shift lost its significance when considering only the patients in group 2. Patients under oral anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy have increased odds of EVD-associated hemorrhage. Metal needles and polyurethane catheters are equivalent in terms of patient safety when there are no midline shift and generalized brain edema.

Moderating effects on HRQoL were found for gender, grade, and independent practice: girls, 7th and 8th grade students, and students with regular independent mindfulness practice benefited most.

CONCLUSIONS
Gender and developmental stage may moderate the effects of mindfulness interventions on HRQoL and offer guidance in designing effective promotive interventions for children and adolescents.

It was found that compared to the routine group, the experimental group experienced lower heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the procedure, fewer pressing times of patient-controlled intravenous analgesia, and lower visual analogue scale scores on post-operation follow-up. Additionally, the experimental group also experienced fewer side effects such as dizziness, nausea, and venous thrombosis of the lower limbs.","The aim of this study was to analyze the application of ultrasound-guided low-dose dexmedetomidine combined with lumbosacral plexus block based on artificial intelligence algorithm in the surgical treatment of proximal femoral fractures. 104 patients with proximal femoral fractures were divided into 52 cases in the experimental group (ultrasound-guided lumbosacral plexus block combined with dexmedetomidine based on local fitting image segmentation algorithm) and 52 cases in the routine group (endotracheal intubation and inhalation combined with general anesthesia). An image segmentation algorithm based on local fitting was constructed to enhance the ultrasound image. It was found that in the routine group, the heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at the beginning of intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine, during skin incision, and half an hour after skin incision were significantly lower than those at admission ( P  < 0.05). The pressing times of patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) in the conventional group (17.05 ± 6.85 times) were significantly higher than that in the experimental group (8.55 ± 4.12 times), and the difference was statistically significant ( P  < 0.05). The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at 1, 5, 10, and 15 after operation in the routine group were significantly higher than those in the experimental group ( P  < 0.05).

95,"In BNT-primed participants, non-inferiority was shown for BNT/m1273 (GMC 22","In a single-blind, randomized non-inferiority trial, adults aged 50 and up who had already received a single dose of either ChAd or BNT in the community were randomly assigned to receive a second dose of either the homologous vaccine, m1273, or NVX (Novavax). The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations measured by ELISA at 28 days after the second dose. Non-inferiority was shown for ChAd/m1273 and BNT/m1273 but not for ChAd/NVX or BNT/NVX compared to homologous schedules. There were 15 serious adverse events, none of which were considered related to immunization. The trial was funded by the UK Vaccine Task Force, CEPI and the National Institute for Health Research, and NVX vaccine was supplied by Novavax.","BACKGROUND
Given the importance of flexible use of different COVID-19 vaccines within the same schedule to facilitate rapid deployment, we studied mixed priming schedules incorporating an adenoviral-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [ChAd], AstraZeneca), two mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 [BNT], Pfizer-BioNTech, and mRNA-1273 [m1273], Moderna) and a nanoparticle vaccine containing SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and Matrix-M adjuvant (NVX-CoV2373 [NVX], Novavax).

METHODS
Com-COV2 is a single-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial in which adults aged 50 years and older, previously immunised with a single dose of ChAd or BNT in the community, were randomly assigned (in random blocks of three and six) within these cohorts in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a second dose intramuscularly (8-12 weeks after the first dose) with the homologous vaccine, m1273, or NVX. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations measured by ELISA in heterologous versus homologous schedules at 28 days after the second dose, with a non-inferiority criterion of the GMR above 0·63 for the one-sided 98·75% CI. The primary analysis was on the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were done for all participants who received a dose of study vaccine. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 27841311.

FINDINGS
Between April 19 and May 14, 2021, 1072 participants were enrolled at a median of 9·4 weeks after receipt of a single dose of ChAd (n=540, 47% female) or BNT (n=532, 40% female). In ChAd-primed participants, geometric mean concentration (GMC) 28 days after a boost of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in recipients of ChAd/m1273 (20 114 ELISA laboratory units [ELU]/mL [95% CI 18 160 to 22 279]) and ChAd/NVX (5597 ELU/mL [4756 to 6586]) was non-inferior to that of ChAd/ChAd recipients (1971 ELU/mL [1718 to 2262]) with a GMR of 10·2 (one-sided 98·75% CI 8·4 to ∞) for ChAd/m1273 and 2·8 (2·2 to ∞) for ChAd/NVX, compared with ChAd/ChAd. In BNT-primed participants, non-inferiority was shown for BNT/m1273 (GMC 22 978 ELU/mL [95% CI 20 597 to 25 636]) but not for BNT/NVX (8874 ELU/mL [7391 to 10 654]), compared with BNT/BNT (16 929 ELU/mL [15 025 to 19 075]) with a GMR of 1·3 (one-sided 98·75% CI 1·1 to ∞) for BNT/m1273 and 0·5 (0·4 to ∞) for BNT/NVX, compared with BNT/BNT; however, NVX still induced an 18-fold rise in GMC 28 days after vaccination. There were 15 serious adverse events, none considered related to immunisation.

INTERPRETATION
Heterologous second dosing with m1273, but not NVX, increased transient systemic reactogenicity compared with homologous schedules. Multiple vaccines are appropriate to complete primary immunisation following priming with BNT or ChAd, facilitating rapid vaccine deployment globally and supporting recognition of such schedules for vaccine certification.

A menstrual cup can be a good solution for menstrual hygiene management in economically challenged settings. As part of a pilot study we assessed uptake and maintenance of cup use among young school girls in Kenya.

METHODS
A total of 192 girls between 14 to 16 years were enrolled in 10 schools in Nyanza Province, Western Kenya; these schools were assigned menstrual cups as part of the cluster-randomized pilot study. Girls were provided with menstrual cups in addition to training and guidance on use, puberty education, and instructions for menstrual hygiene. During repeated individual visits with nurses, girls reported use of the menstrual cup and nurses recorded colour change of the cup.

RESULTS
Girls were able to keep their cups in good condition, with only 12 cups (6.3%) lost (dropped in toilet, lost or destroyed). Verbally reported cup use increased from 84% in the first 3 months (n = 143) to 96% after 9 months (n = 74). Colour change of the cup, as 'uptake' indicator of use, was detected in 70.8% of 192 participants, with a median time of 5 months (range 1-14 months). Uptake differed by school and was significantly higher among girls who experienced menarche within the past year (adjusted risk ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.04-1.60), and was faster among girls enrolled in the second study year (hazard ratio 3.93, 95% CI 2.09-7.38). The kappa score comparing self-report and cup colour observation was 0.044 (p = 0.028), indicating that agreement was only slightly higher than by random chance.

CONCLUSIONS
Objective evidence through cup colour change suggests school girls in rural Africa can use menstrual cups, with uptake improving with peer group education and over time.

97,"There was a 4% lower rate of increase in total modifiable CV risk among intervention patients relative to control patients (relative rate ratio [RR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.98).","This cluster randomized clinical trial assessed whether a clinical decision support system aimed at primary care clinicians improved cardiovascular health for adult primary care patients with serious mental illness. The study found that the intervention resulted in a 4% lower rate of increase in total modifiable CV risk among intervention patients compared to control patients, driven by cumulative effects of incremental changes in individual modifiable risk factors. These findings suggest the value of using CDS to prompt early primary care intervention for adults with SMI.","Importance
Adults with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, collectively termed serious mental illness (SMI), have shortened life spans compared with people without SMI. The leading cause of death is cardiovascular (CV) disease.
Objective
To assess whether a clinical decision support (CDS) system aimed at primary care clinicians improves CV health for adult primary care patients with SMI.
Design, Setting, and Participants
In this cluster randomized clinical trial conducted from March 2, 2016, to September 19, 2018, restricted randomization assigned 76 primary care clinics in 3 Midwestern health care systems to receive or not receive a CDS system aimed at improving CV health among patients with SMI. Eligible clinics had at least 20 patients with SMI; clinicians and their adult patients with SMI with at least 1 modifiable CV risk factor not at the goal set by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines were included. Statistical analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis from January 10, 2019, to December 29, 2021.
Intervention
The CDS system assessed modifiable CV risk factors and provided personalized treatment recommendations to clinicians and patients.
Main Outcomes and Measures
Patient-level change in total modifiable CV risk over 12 months, summed from individual modifiable risk factors (smoking, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, and hemoglobin A1c level).
Results
A total of 80 clinics were randomized; 4 clinics were excluded for having fewer than 20 eligible patients, leaving 42 intervention clinics and 34 control clinics. A total of 8937 patients with SMI (4922 women [55.1%]; mean [SD] age, 48.4 [13.5] years) were enrolled. There was a 4% lower rate of increase in total modifiable CV risk among intervention patients relative to control patients (relative rate ratio [RR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.98). The intervention favored patients who were 18 to 29 years of age (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.98) or 50 to 59 years of age (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.96), Black (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98), or White (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.98). Men (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99) and women (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.97), as well as patients with any SMI subtype (bipolar disorder: RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99; schizoaffective disorder: RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.98; schizophrenia: RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-0.99) also benefited from the intervention. Despite treatment effects favoring the intervention, there were no significant differences in individual modifiable risk factors.
Conclusions and Relevance
This CDS intervention resulted in a rate of change in total modifiable CV risk that was 4% lower among intervention patients compared with control patients. Results were driven by the cumulative effects of incremental and mostly nonsignificant changes in individual modifiable risk factors. These findings emphasize the value of using CDS to prompt early primary care intervention for adults with SMI.

Results showed that respiratory infection events occurred significantly less often in patients receiving dupilumab and there was also significantly less systemic anti-infective medication use in these patients. These results suggest that dupilumab may reduce the incidence of respiratory infections in these patients, but further studies are needed to investigate the mechanism behind this reduction.","BACKGROUND
Patients with asthma and/or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) experience recurrent respiratory tract infections. Dupilumab targets type 2 inflammation, a common underlying pathophysiology of both conditions, with proven efficacy.

OBJECTIVE
To examine investigator-reported respiratory infection adverse events and anti-infective medication use with dupilumab versus placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma or severe CRSwNP.

METHODS
We performed a post hoc analysis of the pivotal phase 3 trials LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST (NCT02414854) and LIBERTY NP SINUS-52 (NCT02898454) in moderate-to-severe asthma and severe CRSwNP, respectively.

RESULTS
Investigator-reported respiratory infection events occurred at a significantly lower incidence in patients treated with dupilumab versus placebo, in both asthma (22% lower; P < .0001; 95% CI 0.71-0.85) and CRSwNP (38% lower; P <.0001; 95% CI 0.51-0.75). Reported upper and lower respiratory tract infection events were numerically or significantly lower in dupilumab-treated patients in both conditions, as were the number of patients experiencing investigator-reported infections. Significantly less systemic anti-infective medication use occurred in dupilumab versus placebo in asthma (24% lower; P < .0001; 95% CI 0.70-0.83) and CRSwNP patients (49% lower; P < .0001; 95% CI 0.43-0.61), and significantly fewer dupilumab-treated patients used anti-infective medications. When examined by season and month, the data indicated that investigator-reported respiratory infections and anti-infective medication use were less frequent in dupilumab- versus placebo-treated patients throughout the calendar year.

CONCLUSIONS
Dupilumab treatment was associated with a reduced incidence of investigator-reported respiratory infections in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma or severe CRSwNP. Further studies are required to determine the mechanism behind this reduction.

Results showed that the CBT group had significantly better outcomes than the PST group at post-intervention, and this effect was maintained during the lockdown period. In addition, the CBT group had significantly less fear of COVID-19 than the PST group. The study also found that social anxiety severity was positively correlated with fear of COVID-19, and that individuals with comorbidities had significantly more fear. The hierarchical multiple regression revealed that SPIN post-intervention, COVID-19 fear, and duration of SAD predicted social anxiety severity during the post-lockdown period.","There is a paucity of research on the role of COVID-19 related fear and lockdown on social anxiety disorder (SAD).
